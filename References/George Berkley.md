an [Anglo-Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_people "Anglo-Irish people") philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called "immaterialism" (later referred to as "[subjective idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_idealism "Subjective idealism")" by others). This theory denies the existence of [material substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are [ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea "Idea") [perceived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception "Perception") by the [minds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind") and, as a result, cannot exist without being perceived. Berkeley is also known for his critique of [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction "Abstraction"), an important premise in his argument for immaterialism.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley#cite_note-Jesseph-7)

Proposed(at least I think), the question of If a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound? His answer...

The answer to this question depends on the definition of sound. We can define sound as our perception of air vibrations. Therefore, **sound does not exist if we** do not hear it. When a tree falls, the motion disturbs the air and sends off air waves."
