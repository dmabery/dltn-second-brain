# How to live

What should you be doing right now? Obviously there's many factors, but here's what I suggest for your top priorities.  
  
First of all, prioritize your health. Like it or not, you're a physical object. Everything you do, say, or think is done by your meat. If you haven't done any cardio recently, do some. If your diet is terrible, get better food. If you're smoking, stop. If you're stressing the hell out, chill.  
  
Second, try to attain reasonable financial security. I don't mean try to get richâ€”a lot of people basically toss away the best years of their life that way. But constantly worrying about having a place to live or food to eat will make it impossible for you to be happy.  
  
Third, maintain good relationships. Every study says that this is actually what makes people happy. Making new friends or family is great, but also hard. (Yes, there's the "old-fashioned" way of making new family, but that isn't easy either!) Before trying to create new relationships, are you maintaining your existing ones? Do you have friends or family you haven't talked to in a long time? Talk to them. Do you have relationships that have deteriorated? Undeteriorate them.

There's no way to win at life. It might feel like you're winning if you have millions of dollars and are beloved by your peers or have lots of beautiful babies or whatever. By all means, do those things if you want! But you're still a hunk of meat and everything you want is programmed into you by the ruthless logic of evolution. In the long-run, entropy eats the universe and weâ€™re all forgotten. I'm always surprised how few people dedicate their lives to weirder things. Why not buy a big chunk of desert and paint it green? Why not study how to brew tea that raccoons would like? Itâ€™s really up to you, and thereâ€™s no wrong answers. [[You can't win]] #infinite-game
