- If you worry about your startup's competition...
  I overcame that anxiety by writing this essay.
  How to beat competition: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545905483681796))
1
- I used to worry about three competitive dynamics:
  • What if competitors turn my business into a feature?
  • If I don’t build this feature now, a competitor will and I’ll lose my headstart.
  • What if my competitor's market dominance makes acquisition costs unsustainably high? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545906666471426))
1
- I reduced these anxieties by realizing this: 
  *Customer retention is the antidote to competition.*
  Because, when fearing competition, you're often fearing: 
  • Unsustainable economics
  • Losing customers to competitors
  The second one caused most of my stress. So I tackled it: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545908054757376))
1
- I realized that a key to boosting retention is to foster *brand advocates.*
  Brand advocates are loyal users who don’t jump ship when a competitor introduces a great feature or lowers pricing. 
  Why?
  Because you've treated them well and they see themselves in your startup. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545909443104775))
1
- If you've made brand advocates, then when a competitor releases a great feature, you simply:
  1. Validate the feature is worth matching
  2. Assign appropriate resources
  3. Openly communicate the new roadmap to your users
  That’s it. Be less anxious about being one-upped. Why? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545910776893442))
1
- Because you have *much more time* to catch up to competitors than you think. 
  Users RARELY disappear the instant a competitor one-ups you. 
  Not even 4 weeks later. 
  Often, not even 4 months later. 
  Perhaps a year later if you’ve utterly failed to respond to a changing market. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545912030916609))
1
- That should be comforting:
  It means you can be on less anxious high-alert for competitors' movements. 
  Just focus on not burying your head in the sand for too long—and fostering brand advocates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545913318608898))
1
- How do you foster brand advocates?
  I read this quote from Zero to One: 
  “All companies inherently have monopolies over their brands.” 
  Essentially, Airbnb will forever be the only “Airbnb.” 
  Slack will forever be the only "Slack." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545914551771138))
1
- Make brand advocates by honing your brand to the point where customers would be upset if they had to switch to a competitor. 
  It'd be like removing part of their routine or identity.
  They'd stop being "the girl always wearing Nikes" or "the guy with Slack stickers everywhere." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545915881365508))
1
- People become your brand advocates in a few ways:
  • They feel gratitude for what you've done for them
  • They empathize with your team's personal stories
  • You make them look cool/high-status
  • They align with your product's mission
  Connect with customers on these levels. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545917156401152))
1
- If you do that, once a competitor adds a great feature, customers think:
  "Wow, that's cool! But, I'm going to wait until [Slack] offers this. Hopefully that's soon, but if not, I'll figure out a work-around." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545918574104577))
1
- In other words:
  The greater the percentage of users who are brand advocates, the stickier your business is, and the less you have to stress about your competition blindsiding you.
  That’s a critical concept founders overlook: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545919777787904))
1
- Startups don’t suddenly die by being blindsided by competitors. 
  They usually die slow deaths by not remaining competitive over the long-term. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545921052934145))
1
- To recap:
  Effective entrepreneurs aren’t overly-focused on competition; effective entrepreneurs are overly-focused on users. 
  They look inward, not outward. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1404545922428669955))
1
- After realizing this many years ago, I stopped fearing competition so much.
  Follow along as I deconstruct marketing, writing, and startups.
