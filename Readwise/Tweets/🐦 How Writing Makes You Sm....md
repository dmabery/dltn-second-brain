## Highlights

- How writing makes you smarter: A Monday thread.
  1. Writing is a neuron-pumping activity that challenges your brain to translate shapeless ideas into logical, syntax-conforming sentences. 
  It’s mental gymnastics when you have to take a fuzzy concept and transform it into words.
1
- 2. It changes your vocabulary, as you have to find the right words that match up to your ideas.

- 3. It changes the way you speak, as it forces you to work on sentence structure, composition, and general idea communication...which informs the way you sound OFF the page as well.

- 4. It helps you understand yourself better, as you get to see your ideas translate from a vague concept inside your head to words and phrases on a page. 
  It forces you to externalize your inner monologue.

- 5. It strengthens your logos. 
  In Rhetoric, logos = logic. 
  As you write down your ideas, you’ll fine-tune how to logically present ideas as you sort through translating your thoughts into words.

- 5. (cont) If you think of an invisible reader as you write, you’ll be driven to write convincingly with logic-driven structure. 
  Again, you’ll challenge yourself to make sense of things, rather than leaving ideas as gray, ambiguous concepts inside your head.

- 6. So here’s my challenge for you:
  I want you to set aside 15 minutes once a week to open up a notebook (or Google Doc) and write about an idea you have. 
  Pick something you’re really interested in or passionate about, and then explain why.

- 7. There are no grades.
  No comment section for people to say, “Yeah, BUT…”
  This is your mental exercise. 
  Try it out. Maybe even make it a weekly thing. 
  I think you’ll be surprised by all you get from it.
