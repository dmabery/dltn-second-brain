## Highlights
1
- When I was 17, I was in a school shooting. It was traumatic
  I'm convinced that overcoming fear is the secret to winning at startups, business and life:
  Here's some tips and lessons on overcoming FEAR:
1
- The greatest productivity tip of all time:
  It isn't to drink coffee or get 8 hours of sleep or use Notion 
  It is conquering your fears. Period.
1
- Life is too short for fears
  "Adjusted for the subjective increase in how fast time passes, life is half over by 23 or 24. Don't waste time."
  h/t @samaltman 
  Time is ticking
1
- Beat your "amygdala"
  Amygdala = the part of your brain that registers all your fear
  When you have an experience that creates fear, it gets "coded" into your brain
  For the rest of your life, your amygdala, is tainted with your past experience
  Arm wrestle your amygdala and win
1
- Rejection sucks. But it's one of the most useful ways to refine your craft
  Mindset shift: use fear to learn & motivate, not run away & demotivate
1
- The only "true" way of getting rid of 100% your fears:
  Stop putting yourself out there. Don't do anything worthwhile. Care about what others think about you
  That's a sad way to live
  Point: A healthy amount of fear is healthy
1
- Building a startup is scary. You're basically a wild explorer
  Just have fun and know that you're sailing into unknown waters
  You might find gold or you might not, but I promise it will be a hell of a journey https://t.co/KdMqjLCO68

- Statements rooted in fear:
  - Get a safe job and stick with it
  - Don’t question the established order
  - Don’t talk to strangers
  - Go to college
  - Always have a plan B
  - etc.
  Often times these "truths" drive the worst decisions

- How to escape fear:
  1. Trust fear
  2. See #1
1
- Reframe your fear:
  Are the butterflies in your stomach nervousness or excitement‽
  Is your heart racing because of terror or because of eager anticipation?
  Are you scared or are you pumped up?
  Reframing is a bravery superpower

- A fear of mine:
  Asking people to follow me on Twitter
  Doing it anyways
  Follow me on Twitter @gregisenberg as I share startup tips and insights on building internet communities
1
- Mini-fears are the secret to overcoming big fears
  It brings "the positive motivation loop" (h/t @nateliason)
  Take large fear: break it up to many mini-fears. If you want to run 5k, start buy running around the block
  Crawl. Walk. Run. https://t.co/U5gubGCGdk

- Understand the "knowns" and the "unknowns" of your projects
  “Whatever you’re doing, don’t give a voice to things you’re not able to change.” - Vince Vaughn
  Habit: write down your knowns & unknowns every single week
1
- Reminder: every person on earth is suffering from fear
  Let them know there are no bears running after them. Most fears aren't due to real danger
  Unlock their potential
1
- Common fears:
  - Fear of change
  - Fear of danger
  - Fear of the unknown
  - Fear of being judged
  - Fear of being scared
  What am I missing?
1
- Don't completely rely on reassurance from friends/colleagues
  Reassure is nice. But it's a crutch
1
- Society is organized to sell into your fears:
  - Retirement plans
  - Heated blankets
  - Insurance
  - Substances 
  Don't blindly buy into products that sell "security"
