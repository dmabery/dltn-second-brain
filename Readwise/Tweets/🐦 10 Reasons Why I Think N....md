- 10 reasons why I think now is the greatest time to launch a startup
  You should probably consider starting something
  Just listen to this: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283135945850882))
1
- You can start with the community 
  I’ve identified ~8000 communities that could be unbundled from Reddit 
  - They are thriving 
  - They could make you ~$1m/year of revenue
  - You often need $400 max to build MVP to tap that untapped value
  - It's fun
  Sounds like a dream job to me ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283138470879236))
1
- People in Silicon Valley don’t have an edge on you
  SF held the monopoly on startups for decades. Now, being in SF doesn’t matter for 99% of businesses
  Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise
  The world is flat and is staying flat
  Hell yeah. That feels good to say ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283139368448007))
1
- You have 10x the amount of funding sources
  You used to have to rely on VCs. Not anymore
  To name a few:
  - Fund via your community
  - Fund via NFTs
  - Fund via pre-sales
  - Fund via tokens
  - Fund via accelerators all over the world
  - Etc 
  All of a sudden, you have 10x the options ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283140194689027))
1
- Niche businesses can be worth billions
  People used to laugh at niche. Why “go small” when you could “go big”?
  The way to go big right now IS to go small
  Large tech companies can’t be everything to everyone ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283141008437253))
1
- My head spins thinking about how much is changing in our world right now
  Ex:
  - Millions of creators who need support 
  - Communities that are ripe for tokenization
  - ↑ social commerce
  - ↑ sustainability products
  - ↑ internet usage across the globe
  This won’t last forever ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283141780189188))
1
- Everything is unbundling before our eyes
  - Facebook groups
  - eBay
  - Zoom
  - Etsy
  - Reddit
  - Udemy
  What a wonderful time to be building a startup ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283142585491460))

- No-code/low-code tools
  Launching isn’t the hard part anymore. It’s community building ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283143373967362))
1
- There's so much available to learn online
  The right Discord servers or Podcasts are worth 10x more than a Harvard Business Degree
  Bonus: it's a pandemic. You have more time. Seize the day and find these sacred sources of wisdom ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283144351281155))

- You can attract niches easier than ever
  Start with the community, then build software
  vs.
  Start with software, then build community
  Point: you increase your odds of success by building community-first ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283145357885440))
1
- You can run a $100m/year business from your iPhone 
  I have a friend who’s company makes $100m/yr
  Facts:
  - He started it in 2018
  - It’s niche
  - Unbundled from a FB Group 
  - Moved from SF to Malta because he likes the vibe 
  - He runs his entire biz from his iPhone on an island! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1373283146268082182))
