## Highlights
1
- Everything has 3 costs:
  1. Upfront cost
  2. Opportunity cost
  3. Maintenance cost
  This applies for material and non-material objects. We tend to focus in 1, sometimes consider 2, and rarely think about 3. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fahdananta/status/1482755715085357066))
