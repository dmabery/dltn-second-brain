## Highlights
1
- To think like a rocket scientist is to look at the world through a different lens. Rocket scientists imagine the unimaginable and solve the unsolvable. They transform failures into triumphs and constraints into advantages. They view mishaps as solvable puzzles rather than insurmountable roadblocks. They’re moved not by blind conviction but by self-doubt; their goal is not short-term results but long-term breakthroughs. They know that the rules aren’t set in stone, the default can be altered, and a new path can be forged. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=85))
1
- we all encounter complex and unfamiliar problems in our daily lives. Those who can tackle these problems—without clear guidelines and with the clock ticking—enjoy an extraordinary advantage. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=100))

- Science, as Carl Sagan put it, is “a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.”12 ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=111))
1
- Critical thinking and creativity don’t come naturally to us. We’re hesitant to think big, reluctant to dance with uncertainty, and afraid of failure. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=131))
1
- Companies fail because they stare at the rearview mirror and keep calling the same plays from the same playbook. ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=133))

- More accurately, we can say that people made a classic mistake: trying to make something appear definite when in fact it isn’t. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=319))
1
- You’ll learn how our obsession with certainty leads us astray and why all progress takes place in uncertain conditions. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=320))
1
- Our yearning for certainty leads us to pursue seemingly safe solutions—by looking for our keys under street lamps. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=355))
1
- If you stick to the familiar, you won’t find the unexpected. Those who get ahead in this century will dance with the great unknown and find danger, rather than comfort, in the status quo. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=361))
1
- Our ability to make the most out of uncertainty is what creates the most potential value. We should be fueled not by a desire for a quick catharsis but by intrigue. Where certainty ends, progress begins. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=408))
1
- “The great obstacle to discovering,” historian Daniel J. Boorstin writes, “was not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge.” ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=433))
1
- “I think it’s much more interesting to live not knowing,” he remarked, “than to have answers which might be wrong.” ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=459))
1
- Science, as George Bernard Shaw said, “can never solve one problem without raising 10 more problems.”26 As some gaps in our knowledge are filled, others emerge. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=476))
1
- The connoisseurs of uncertainty know that an experiment with a known outcome is not an experiment at all and that revisiting the same answers is not progress. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=518))
1
- When scientists make statements, “the question is not whether it is true or false but rather how likely it is to be true or false.” ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=546))
1
- Any future breakthroughs will occur only when scientists embrace uncertainty and pay close attention to one of the primary drivers of progress: anomalies. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=554))

- aberration—an exception that proves the rule— ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=582))
1
- “From the good the child expects nothing but good; from the bad, nothing but bad. To expect a good act from the bad, or a bad act from the good, is radically at variance with childhood’s mental methods.” ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=594))
1
- “everything that isn’t perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.” ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=596))
1
- Only when we pay attention to the subtle clues—there’s something off with the data, the explanation seems cursory or superficial, the observation doesn’t quite fit the theory—can the old paradigm give way to the new. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=612))

- plutoed as its word of the year in 2006.58 The word means to “demote or devalue someone or something.” ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=641))
1
- Logic trumped emotion, ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=664))
1
- “People wish to be settled,” wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson, but “only as far as they are unsettled is there any hope for them.” ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=669))
1
- It’s because they have mastered the art of using knowledge to reduce uncertainty. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=686))
1
- “In order to stay calm in a high-stress, high-stakes situation, all you really need is knowledge.… Being forced to confront the prospect of failure head-on—to study it, dissect it, tease apart all its components and consequences—really works.”67 ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=687))
1
- This approach has another upside. If we figure out what we know and what we don’t know, we contain uncertainty and reduce the fear associated with ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=693))
1
- Knowledge turns an uncertain situation into a high-stakes game of peekaboo. Yes, spaceflight is no laughing matter—there are lives at stake—but astronauts contain uncertainty the same way that infants do: by figuring out who’s going to appear on the other end when the hands open up. ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=704))
1
- “Named must your fear be before banish it you can.” ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=714))
1
- Ask yourself, What’s the worst-case scenario? And how likely is that scenario, given what I know? ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=716))
1
- After you determine what’s truly worth being alarmed about, you can take measures to mitigate risks by calling two plays from the rocket-science playbook: redundancies and margins of safety. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=725))
1
- Redundancy in aerospace refers to a backup created to avoid a single point of failure that can compromise the entire mission. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=729))
1
- Excessive redundancy can also backfire and compromise reliability, instead of improving ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=750))
1
- They may assume—incorrectly—that even if something goes wrong, there’s a fail-safe in place. Redundancy, in other words, can’t be a substitute for good design. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=754))
1
- Think about it: Where are the redundancies in your own life? Where’s the emergency brake or the spare tire in your company? How will you deal with the loss of a valuable team member, a critical distributor, or an important client? What will you do if your household loses a source of income? The system must be designed to continue operating even if a component fails. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=755))
1
- The same approach saved the astronauts on the Apollo 13 mission to the Moon. An oxygen tank exploded near the Moon, depleting the power and oxygen supply in the command module. So the three astronauts had to move out of the command module and into the lunar module, using it as a lifeboat to return home. But the lunar module—the small spider-shaped spacecraft designed only to shuttle two astronauts between the lunar surface and the orbiting spacecraft—quickly filled up with dangerous levels of carbon dioxide with three men breathing in and out. There were square canisters in the command module to absorb carbon dioxide, but they wouldn’t fit the round filtration system in the lunar module.

    - Note: Story
1
- Start walking because, as Newton’s first law goes, objects in motion tend to stay in motion—once you get going, you will keep going. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=800))
1
- Moore’s law, the principle named after the Intel cofounder Gordon Moore. According to the principle, computer power develops exponentially, doubling every two years. A computer that would have filled an entire room in the 1970s now fits in your pocket and packs far more computing punch. But rocket technology bucks Moore’s law. “We sleep easy knowing that next year’s software will be better than this year’s,” Musk explains, but “rockets’ [cost] actually gets progressively worse every year.” ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=830))
1
- “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” “Don’t rock the boat.” “Don’t change horses in the middle of the stream.” “Go with the devil you know.” The default carries immense power, even in advanced industries like rocket science. This idea is called path dependence: What we’ve done before shapes what we do next. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=862))
1
- Fortune 500 companies shun innovation because their compensation is tied to short-term quarterly outcomes that may be temporarily disrupted by forging a new path. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=879))
1
- “It’s difficult to get a man to understand something,” Upton Sinclair said, “when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=880))
1
- Process, by definition, is backward looking. It was developed in response to yesterday’s troubles. If we treat it like a sacred pact—if we don’t question it—process can impede forward movement. Over time, our organizational arteries get clogged with outdated procedures. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=895))
1
- “Do we own the process or does the process own us?”7 ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=900))
1
- knowledge should inform, not constrain. Knowledge should enlighten, not obscure. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=905))
1
- Resisting this hardwiring for conformity causes us emotional distress—literally. A neurological study showed that nonconformity activates the amygdala and produces what the ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=918))
1
- Businesses plant their lightning rod where lightning struck last and wait for it to strike again. This worked once, so let’s do it again. And again. And again. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=922))
1
- Over time, imitation makes the original obsolete. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=927))
1
- “When you try to improve on existing techniques,” says Astro Teller, the head of X, Google’s moonshot factory, “you’re in a smartness contest with everyone who came before you. Not a good contest to be in.” ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=936))
1
- The credit for first-principles thinking goes to Aristotle, who defined it as “the first basis from which a thing is known.” ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=946))
1
- “Talent hits a target no one else can hit,” philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said, but “genius hits a target no one else can see.” ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=953))
1
- As the saying goes, argue for your limitations, and you get to keep them. ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1040))
1
- What in your own world is the cat from the meditation fable? Which unnecessary relic of the past clouds your thinking and hampers your progress? What do you assume you’re supposed to do simply because everyone around you is doing it? Can you question this assumption and replace it with something better? ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1042))
1
- “By invoking more than one reason,” observes author and scholar Nassim Nicholas Taleb, “you are trying to convince yourself to do something.” ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1054))

- “To create the company of tomorrow, you must break down the bad habits, silos, and inhibitors that exist today.” ([Location 1160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1160))
1
- Bezos follows a similar approach at Amazon.34 When ebooks began to threaten Amazon’s physical book business, Bezos embraced the challenge instead of turning away from it. He told one of his associates, “I want you to proceed as if your job is to put everyone selling books out of a job,” including Amazon itself. The business model this exercise produced eventually shot Amazon to the top of the ebook market. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1173))
1
- Why might my boss pass me up for a promotion? • Why is this prospective employer justified in not hiring me? • Why are customers making the right decision by buying from our competitors? ([Location 1190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1190))
1
- As Einstein said, everything should be made “as simple and as few as possible.”36 This principle is known as Occam’s razor. The name, I admit, is unfortunate. It sounds like a cheap late-night horror flick, but it’s actually a mental model named after William of Ockham, a fourteenth-century philosopher. The model is often stated as a rule: The simplest solution to a problem is the correct one. ([Location 1204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1204))
1
- Carl Sagan put it well: “When faced with two hypotheses that explain the data equally well,” you should “choose the simpler.”37 In other words, “when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not unicorns.”38 ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1209))
1
- technique called combinatory play to produce breakthrough works, and you’ll learn how to apply it in your own life. ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1317))
1
- favorite example of mine is about a kindergarten teacher who was walking around the room to check each child’s work as they drew pictures. “What are you drawing?” he asked one student. The girl said, “I’m drawing God.” The teacher was shocked at this deviation from the standard curriculum. He said, “But no one knows what God looks like.” The girl replied, “They will in a minute.” ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1429))
1
- I viewed boredom—which I define as large chunks of unstructured time free of distractions—as something to be avoided. ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1484))
1
- “We are drowning in information,” biologist E. O. Wilson said, “while starving for wisdom.” ([Location 1502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1502))
1
- As the saying goes, it’s the silence between the notes that makes the music. ([Location 1514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1514))
1
- A breakthrough begins with asking a good question, laboring over the answer intensely, and being stuck in idleness for days, weeks, and sometimes years. Research shows that incubation periods—the time you spend feeling stuck—boosts the ability to solve problems. ([Location 1538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1538))
1
- You must be patient enough to pursue the whisper and perceptive enough to receive it when it arrives. ([Location 1577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1577))
1
- “To create,” biologist François Jacob said, “is to recombine.” ([Location 1605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1605))
1
- Decades later, Steve Jobs echoed the same sentiment: “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something.… [T]hey’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.”60 ([Location 1606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1606))
1
- Einstein called this idea “combinatory play,” which he believed is the “essential feature in productive thought.” ([Location 1611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1611))
1
- Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody,” considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time, is like a musical sandwich, blending an opening and closing ballad with hard rock and opera in the middle. ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1638))
1
- Combinatory play has also produced many breakthrough technologies. Larry Page and Sergey Brin adopted an idea from academia—the frequency of citations to an academic paper indicates its popularity—and applied it to the search engine to create Google. Steve Jobs famously borrowed from calligraphy to create multiple typefaces and proportionally spaced fonts on the Macintosh. Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings was inspired by the subscription model used at his gym: “You could pay $30 or $40 a month and work out as little or as much as you wanted.”71 ([Location 1644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1644))
1
- As these examples show, to connect apples and oranges, you have to collect them first. The more diverse your collection, the more interesting your output becomes. ([Location 1663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1663))
1
- The principle of combinatory play applies not just to ideas, but to people as well. As we’ll see in the next section, when people from different disciplines are combined, the result is more than the sum of their parts. ([Location 1675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1675))
1
- People should be able to cultivate insights on their own, come together to exchange those insights with the group, and then return to working alone, cycling between solitude and collaboration. The pattern is similar to the focus and boredom cycle that we explored earlier. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1716))
1
- In Zen Buddhism, this principle is known as shoshin, or beginner’s mind.87 As the Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki writes, “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind there are few.” ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1745))
1
- Loon was a moonshot—a breakthrough technology that brings a radical solution to an enormous problem. This chapter is about the power of moonshot thinking, which is responsible for audacious projects like Loon. ([Location 1807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1807))
1
- Pursuing a moonshot puts you in a different league—and often an entirely different game—from that of your competitors, making the established plays and routines largely irrelevant. ([Location 1833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1833))
1
- The story, as you may have guessed, is a microcosm for life. Most of us go after the mice instead of the antelopes. We think the mouse is a sure thing, but the antelope is a moonshot. Mice are everywhere; antelopes are few and far between. What’s more, everyone around us is busy hunting mice. We assume that if we decide to go for antelopes, we might fail and go hungry. ([Location 1846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1846))
1
- But as Seth Godin explains in his book The Icarus Deception, there’s a second half to the Icarus myth—one that you probably haven’t heard. In addition to telling Icarus not to fly too high, Daedalus also told him not to fly too low, because the water would ruin his wings.14 Altitude, as any ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1859))

1
- Take comfort in knowing that Daedalus had his physics all wrong. Air gets cooler, not hotter, as you ascend, so your wings won’t melt. If you pursue the extraordinary, you’ll rise above the stale neural pathways that dominate ordinary thinking. And if you persist—and learn from the inevitable failures that will arise—you’ll eventually grow the wings you need to soar. ([Location 1907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1907))
1
- The flies are the divergent thinkers, fluttering freely until they find the exit. The bees are the convergent thinkers, zeroing in on the seemingly most obvious exit path with a behavior that is ultimately their undoing. ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1920))
1
- Divergent thinking is a way of generating different ideas in an open-minded and free-flowing manner—like flies bouncing around in a glass bottle. ([Location 1922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1922))
1
- “People may often benefit from a could mindset that involves a more expansive exploration of possible solutions before making a final decision.” ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1938))
1
- Convergent thinking alone is dangerous because you’re just relying on the past. What will succeed in the future may not resemble what succeeded in the past.” ([Location 1944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1944))
1
- He found that managers performed abysmally in predicting the success of new circus acts. They relied too heavily on convergent thinking, preferring conventional performances over novel acts. Although creators overestimated the promise of their own ideas, they were far more accurate than managers in judging the creative promise of their colleagues’ novel acts. ([Location 1948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1948))
1
- Recall from earlier that cycling between moments of solitude and moments of collaboration creates the optimal environment for creativity. ([Location 1955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=1955))

- When we’re familiar with a problem, and when we think we have the right answer, we stop seeing alternatives. This tendency is known as the Einstellung effect. In German, einstellung means “set,” and in this context, the term refers to a fixed mental set or attitude. The initial framing of the question—and the initial answer—both stick.

- In the end, two questions that reframed the problems ended up producing one of the most successful interplanetary missions of all time: What if we used airbags instead of a three-legged lander?

1
- Often, we fall in love with our favorite solution and then define the problem as the absence of that solution. “The problem is, we need a better three-legged lander.” “The problem is, we don’t have enough incubators.” In each case, we pursue technology for the sake of technology. We lose the forest for the trees, the purpose for the method, the function for the form. ([Location 2533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=2533))

- From a scientific perspective, opinions present several problems. Opinions are sticky.

- The numbers game, as you may have guessed, is a microcosm for life. Our instinct in our personal and professional lives is to prove ourselves right. Every yes makes us feel good. Every yes makes us stick to what we think we know. Every yes gets us a gold star and a hit of dopamine. But every no brings us one step closer to the truth. Every no provides far more information than a yes does. ([Location 3021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07W53SV45&location=3021))

- A scientific theory is never proven right. It’s simply not proven wrong. Only when scientists work hard—but fail—to beat the crap out of their own ideas can they begin to develop confidence in those ideas. Even after a theory gains acceptance, new facts often emerge, requiring the refinement or complete abandonment of the status quo.

- Most bicycle tires have two layers—the outer layer and an inner tube. Even if the outer layer gets punctured by road debris, the inner tube remains intact. The EDL team compared apples and oranges, copying this design for our airbags and designing a double bladder for double protection. Even if the outer bladder failed, the airbag (and therefore the lander) would survive. The new design was tested and retested until the airbags survived the punishment.
