## Highlights
1
- Marketing is the act of making change happen. Making is insufficient. You haven’t made an impact until you’ve changed someone. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=119))
1
- If you see a way to make things better, you now have a marketing problem. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=128))
1
- They say that the best way to complain is to make things better. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=138))
1
- The first step on the path to make things better is to make better things. ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=140))
1
- Instead of selfish mass, effective marketing now relies on empathy and service. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=156))
1
- commercial enterprise to make large-scale change was simple: buy ads. Ads worked. Ads were a bargain. Ads paid for themselves. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=175))
1
- That means seeing what others see. Building tension. Aligning with tribes. Creating ideas that spread. It means doing the hard work of becoming driven by the market and working with (your part of) that market. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=180))
1
- The other kind of marketing, the effective kind, is about understanding our customers’ worldview and desires so we can connect with them. It’s focused on being missed when you’re gone, on bringing more than people expect to those who trust us. It seeks volunteers, not victims. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=196))
1
- They’re prepared to engage with the market because they know they can contribute to our culture. People like you. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=199))
1
- It’s easier to make products and services for the customers you seek to serve than it is to find customers for your products and services. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=203))
1
- Marketing is the generous act of helping others become who they seek to become. It involves creating honest stories—stories that resonate and spread. Marketers offer solutions, opportunities for humans to solve their problems and move forward. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=206))
1
- Jay Levinson, the father of Guerrilla Marketing, ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=254))
1
- Lester Wunderman, the godfather of direct mail, and Bernadette Jiwa, the doyenne of storytelling. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=255))
1
- You can learn to see how human beings dream, decide, and act. And if you help them become better versions of themselves, the ones they seek to be, you’re a marketer. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=262))
1
- The first step is to invent a thing worth making, with a story worth telling, and a contribution worth talking about. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=264))
1
- The second step is to design and build it in a way that a few people will particularly benefit from and care about. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=265))
1
- The third step is to tell a story that matches the built-in narrative and dreams of that tiny group of people, the smallest viable market. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=266))
1
- The fourth step is the one everyone gets excited about: spread the word. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=268))
1
- The last step is often overlooked: show up—regularly, consistently, and generously, for years and years—to organize and lead and build confidence in the change you seek to make. To earn permission to follow up and to earn enrollment to teach. As ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=268))
1
- Marketers don’t use consumers to solve their company’s problem; they use marketing to solve other people’s problems. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=274))
1
- Persistent, consistent, and frequent stories, delivered to an aligned audience, will earn attention, trust, and action. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=279))
1
- Most of all, marketing begins (and often ends) with what we do and how we do it, not in all the stuff that comes after the thing is designed and shipped. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=286))
1
- If you want to make change, begin by making culture. Begin by organizing a tightly knit group. Begin by getting people in sync. Culture beats strategy—so much that culture is strategy. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=289))
1
- Desire for gain versus avoidance of loss. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=339))
1
- Even if “used” simply meant tried on once before. But it’s not helpful to imagine that everyone knows what you know, wants what you want, believes what you believe. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=349))
1
- Marketing is our quest to make change on behalf of those we serve, and we do it by understanding the irrational forces that drive each of us. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=362))
1
- “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit. They want a quarter-inch hole.” ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=364))
1
- “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit. They want to feel safe and respected.” ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=373))
1
- If you can bring someone belonging, connection, peace of mind, status, or one of the other most desired emotions, you’ve done something worthwhile. The thing you sell is simply a road to achieve those emotions, and we let everyone down when we focus on the tactics, not the outcomes. Who’s it for and what’s it for are the two questions that guide all of our decisions. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=378))
1
- Every organization—every project—is influenced by a primary driving force. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=391))
1
- When you’re marketing-driven, you’re focused on the latest Facebook data hacks, the design of your new logo, and your Canadian pricing model. On the other hand, when you’re market-driven, you think a lot about the hopes and dreams of your customers and their friends. You listen to their frustrations and invest in changing the culture. Being market-driven lasts. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=398))
1
- Regardless of what the specifics are, if you’re a marketer, you’re in the business of making change happen. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=422))
1
- Stumble 1: It’s tempting to pick a grandiose, nearly impossible change: “I want to change the face of music education and make it a top priority across the country.” Well, sure, that’s great, but it’s never been done before, not by someone with your resources. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=424))
1
- Perhaps it makes sense to be very specific about the change you seek to make, and to make it happen. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=429))
1
- Stumble 2: You want to defend what you’re already doing, which is selling what you’ve already been charged with selling. So you reverse-engineer a “change” that matches that thing, and you load it up with buzzwords that mean nothing to anyone. Here’s one I just found: “Activation and engagement for TNT’s new thriller that makes a meta-statement about viewer identity.” ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=431))
1
- Your promise is directly connected to the change you seek to make, and it’s addressed to the people you seek to change. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=450))
1
- So, you need to change someone. Or perhaps a group of someones. Which ones? We don’t care if they all look the same, but it would be really helpful if you had some way to group them together. Do they share a belief? A geography? A demographic, or, more likely, a psychographic? ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=453))
1
- Throughout this book, we’ll return to this essential question: “Who’s it for?” ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=457))
1
- Starbucks didn’t try to sell coffee to people who bought from Dunkin’, and vice versa. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=461))
1
- Starbucks set out to serve someone with a very precise set of beliefs about coffee, time, money, community, opportunity, and luxury—and by obsessing over this group of someones, Starbucks built a brand for the ages. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=463))
1
- But as marketers, we must begin with a worldview, and invite people who share that worldview to join us. “I made this” is a very different statement than, “What do you want?” ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=473))
1
- The relentless pursuit of mass will make you boring, because mass means average, it means the center of the curve, it requires you to offend no one and satisfy everyone. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=491))
1
- The smallest viable market is the focus that, ironically and delightfully, leads to your growth. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=501))
1
- Organize your project, your life, and your organization around the minimum. What’s the smallest market you can survive on? ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=508))
1
- Once you’ve identified the scale, then find a corner of the market that can’t wait for your attention. Go to their extremes. Find a position on the map where you, and you alone, are the perfect answer. Overwhelm this group’s wants and dreams and desires with your care, your attention, and your focus. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=510))
1
- Figure out the simplest useful version of your product, engage with the market, and then improve and repeat. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=513))
1
- Are there people in the world who want you to succeed so badly that they’re willing to pay you to produce the change you seek to make? ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=520))
1
- The goal of the smallest viable audience is to find people who will understand you and will fall in love with where you hope to take them. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=533))
1
- Where are your students? What will they benefit from learning? Are they open to being taught? What will they tell others? ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=549))
1
- If you had a chance to teach us, what would we learn? If you had a chance to learn, what would you like to be taught? ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=553))
1
- Drop a teaspoon of it into a swimming pool, and all the water in the pool will become permanently bright purple. But if you drop it in the ocean, no one will notice. When you seek to share your best work—your best story, your shot at change—it helps if it’s likely to spread. It helps if it’s permanent. ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=557))
1
- What matters is whether you’ve changed the people who trust you, the people who have connected with you, the people you seek to serve. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=571))
1
- It’s entirely possible that your work isn’t as good as it needs to be. But it’s also possible that you failed to be clear about who it was for in the first place. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=579))
1
- My product is for people who believe _________________. I will focus on people who want _________________. I promise that engaging with what I make will help you get _________________. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=583))
1
- There are countless meditation instructors in the United States, all of whom have access to a laptop as connected to the world as Susan’s is. How did the Open Heart Project make such an impact? ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=597))
1
- Start with empathy to see a real need. Not an invented one, not “How can I start a business?” but, “What would matter here?” ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=598))
1
- Sonder is defined as that moment when you realize that everyone around you has an internal life as rich and as conflicted as yours. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=617))
1
- Everything that we purchase—every investment, every trinket, every experience—is a bargain. That’s why we bought it. Because it was worth more than what we paid for it. Otherwise, we wouldn’t ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=634))
1
- motorcycles available for sale in Cleveland. Can you name them? No one can, not even a motorcycle collector. And the same thing is true for ketchup, for insurance brokers, for churches. So, how do we process this, remember this, choose a product? We remember the best one. Best for what? And that’s the key question. Best for us. ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=650))
1
- Your job as a marketer is to find a spot on the map with edges that (some) people want to find. Not a selfish, unique selling proposition, done to maximize your market share, but a generous beacon, a signal flare sent up so that people who are looking for you can easily find you. We’re this, not that. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=657))
1
- Because dog food is for dog owners. It’s for the way it makes them feel, the satisfaction of taking care of an animal that responds with loyalty and affection, the status of buying a luxury good, and the generosity of sharing it. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=666))
1
- The purpose of this example isn’t to help you market dog food better. It’s to understand that there’s almost always a disconnect between performance and appeal. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=673))
1
- You can’t be perfect in the eyes of an early adopter; the best you can do is be interesting. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=686))
1
- “Adherence to conspiracy theory might not always be the result of some perceived lack of control, but rather a deep-seated need for uniqueness.” ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=700))
1
- Instead, we can hope that people might voluntarily trade their attention. Trade it for something they need or want. Trade it because they’re genuinely interested. Trade it because they trust you to keep your promise. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=715))
1
- For each axis, choose something that people care about. It could be something like convenience, price, healthfulness, performance, popularity, skill level, or efficacy. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=768))
1
- We’re not so much interested in features as we are in the emotions that those features evoke. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=778))
1
- Here are some axes for you to choose from. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=779))
1
- Instead, we can think of the quest for the edges as: Claims that are true, that we continually double down on in all our actions. Claims that are generous, that exist as a service to the customer. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=808))
1
- Your customer doesn’t know what to do, so he does nothing. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=827))
1
- We made the “doing” easier, which is precisely why we need to outsource that part of our job and focus all our energy onto the hard work of making change happen. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=871))
1
- Effective marketers don’t begin with a solution, with the thing that makes them more clever than everyone else. Instead, we begin with a group we seek to serve, a problem they seek to solve, and a change they seek to make. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=885))
1
- From now on, your customers know more than you do about your competitors. And so your commodity work, no matter how much effort you put into it, is not enough. ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=909))
1
- Good stories: Connect us to our purpose and vision for our career or business. Allow us to celebrate our strengths by remembering how we got from there to here. Deepen our understanding of our unique value and what differentiates us in the marketplace. Reinforce our core values. Help us to act in alignment and make value-based decisions. Encourage us to respond to customers instead of react to the marketplace. Attract customers who want to support businesses that reflect or represent their values. Build brand loyalty and give customers a story to tell. Attract the kind of like-minded employees we want. Help us to stay motivated and continue to do work we’re proud ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=934))
1
- great marketing is the generous and audacious work of saying, “I see a better alternative; come with me.” ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=948))
1
- A professional plays a role, doing the best possible work, regardless of the day or the patient or the client. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=996))
1
- If you need to be authentic to do your best work, you’re not a professional, you’re a fortunate amateur. Fortunate, ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1017))
1
- Emotional labor is the work we do to provide service. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1022))
1
- We sell feelings, status, and connection, not tasks or stuff. ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1045))
1
- The crowd didn’t invent the Model T, the smartphone, or rap. The crowd didn’t invent JetBlue, City Bakery, or charity: water either. Crowdfunding is one thing, but the crowd isn’t that good at inventing a breakthrough. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1048))
1
- There are three common confusions that many of us get stuck on. The first is that people confuse wants and needs. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1051))
1
- The second is that people are intimately aware of their wants (which they think of as needs) but they are absolutely terrible at inventing new ways to address those wants. ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1054))
1
- Don’t begin with your machines, your inventory, or your tactics. Don’t begin with what you know how to do or some sort of distraction about your mission. Instead, begin with dreams and fears, with emotional states, and with the change your customers seek. ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1093))
1
- Marketers make change. We change people from one emotional state to another. We take people on a journey; we help them become the person they’ve dreamed of becoming, a little bit at a time. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1101))
1
- Like real estate brokers, most of us do our most important work when we traffic in emotions, not commodities. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1117))
1
- If you want to be financially well off, you probably need to deliver enough value to the right people that they will happily pay you for it. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1127))
1
- Choose your extremes, find the people you seek to change, and show up with your offer. ([Location 1145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1145))
1
- Find the things you think that those you engage with will be attracted to and will trust. The typefaces, the pricing, the offers, the images, the interfaces . . . and cut them up, break them down into the original indivisible memes within. Then rebuild something new on top of these pieces. ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1154))
1
- But without a doubt, the heart and soul of a thriving enterprise is the irrational pursuit of becoming irresistible. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1181))
1
- Your best customers become your new salespeople. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1187))
1
- The alternative is to seek a path, not a miracle. ([Location 1212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1212))
1
- How many people outside of HQ use it every day? How often are they sending you suggestions to make it better? ([Location 1214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1214))
1
- How many people are insisting that their friends and colleagues use it? As in right now. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1215))
1
- If you can’t succeed in the small, why do you believe you will succeed in the large? ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1219))
1
- The challenge for most people who seek to make an impact isn’t winning over the mass market. It’s the micro market. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1230))
1
- They bend themselves into a pretzel trying to please the anonymous masses before they have fifty or one hundred people who would miss them if they were gone. ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1231))
1
- Our hits aren’t hits anymore, not like they used to be. Instead, they are meaningful for a few and invisible to the rest. ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1241))
1
- The critic who doesn’t like your work is correct. He doesn’t like your work. This cannot be argued with. The critic who says that no one else will like your work is wrong.

- If you’re a career coach, then explain why people who don’t hire a coach have made a smart decision. Or explain why people who are using someone else to coach them have done something that makes sense for them.

- When we find the empathy to say, “I’m sorry, this isn’t for you, here’s the phone number of my competitor,” then we also find the freedom to do work that matters. ([Location 1326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1326))

- Everyone always acts in accordance with their internal narratives. ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1333))

- For most of us, though, changing our behavior is driven by our desire to fit in (people like us do things like this) and our perception of our status (affiliation and dominance). ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1339))

1
- We don’t make decisions in a vacuum—instead, we base them on our perception of our cohort. So we buy a $700 baby stroller because we’re smart (or we don’t, because it’s stupid). ([Location 1372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1372))

- Marketers don’t make average stuff for average people. Marketers make change. And they do it by normalizing new behaviors. ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1379))
1
- But that’s okay, because the long tail of culture and the media and change doesn’t need everyone any longer. It’s happy with enough. ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1391))
1
- When we’re comfortable realizing that our work is to change “a culture,” then we can begin to do two bits of hard work: Map and understand the worldview of the culture we seek to change. Focus all our energy on this group. Ignore everyone else. Instead, focus on building and living a story that will resonate with the culture we are seeking to change.

1
- In order to change a culture, we begin with an exclusive cohort. That’s where we can offer the most tension and create the most useful connections. ([Location 1437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1437))

- We create tension when we ask someone to contribute to the bake sale or join our book club. We’re using one force (in this case, social engagement) to overcome another force (the status quo). ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1498))
1
- This is what tension feels like. The tension of being left behind. And marketers who cause change cause tension. ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1523))
1
- If you care enough about the change you seek to make, you will care enough to generously and respectfully create tension on behalf of that change. ([Location 1539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1539))
1
- We don’t want to feel left out, left behind, uninformed, or impotent. We want to get ahead. We want to be in sync. We want to do what people like us are doing. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1553))

- But it’s not clear that we have much choice . . . because every big decision is made based on our perceptions of status. ([Location 1673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1673))
1
- The idea of status isn’t nearly as simple as it appears. Consider, for those you seek to serve, their external status (how they are seen by their chosen community) and their internal status (who they see when they look in the mirror). ([Location 1675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1675))

- “Who eats first” and “who sits closest to the emperor” are questions that persist to this day. Both are status questions. One involves dominion; the other involves affiliation. ([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1736))

- Semiotics doesn’t care who made the symbol. The symbol is in the mind of the person looking at it. ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1867))

- Send a signal that feels like a sign we already trust, then change it enough to let us know that it’s new, and that it’s yours. ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1896))
1
- It took thirty years for the idea to spread from the million to everyone, thirty years to build hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap. But it happened because of the brilliant use of semiotics, not technology. At every turn, Apple sent signals, and they sent them in just edgy enough words, fonts, and design that the right people heard the message.

- If you want to build a marketing asset, you need to invest in connection and other nontransferable properties. If people care, you’ve got a brand. ([Location 1941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=1941))

1
- We have the technological levers to treat different people differently if we choose to. But we’ll need to watch and listen to be able to figure out what to offer and who to offer it to. ([Location 2016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2016))

1
- Tactics are easy to understand because we can list them. You use a tactic or you don’t. Strategy is more amorphous. It’s the umbrella over your tactics, the work the tactics seek to support. And your goal is the thing you’ll be betting will happen if your strategy works. ([Location 2052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2052))

- You can change tactics the moment you decide that they’re not helping you achieve your strategy any longer. ([Location 2066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2066))
1
- Step one is to make a product or service that people care enough to search for specifically. You cannot win in a generic search, but you’ll always win if the search is specific enough. And then step two is easy to understand: to be the one they want to find when they go looking. ([Location 2212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2212))

- Marketing changes your pricing. Pricing changes your marketing. ([Location 2219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2219))

- Better to apologize for the price once than to have to excuse a hundred small slights again and again. ([Location 2242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2242))
1
- Low price is the last refuge of a marketer who has run out of generous ideas. ([Location 2261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2261))
1
- A free idea is far more likely to spread, and spread quickly, than an idea that’s tethered to money. ([Location 2270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2270))

- When people are heavily invested (cash or reputation or effort), they often make up a story to justify their commitment. And that story carries trust. ([Location 2293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2293))
1
- Generosity in terms of free work, constant discounts, and plenty of uncompensated overtime isn’t really generous. Because you can’t sustain it. Because soon you’ll be breaking the promises you made. ([Location 2297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2297))
1
- On the other hand, showing generosity with your bravery, your empathy, and your respect is generous indeed. ([Location 2299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2299))
1
- You don’t assume that just because you’re running for President or coming to the end of the quarter or launching a new product that you have the right to break the deal. You don’t. ([Location 2369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2369))

- In a world that scans instead of reads, that gossips instead of researching, it turns out that the best way to earn trust is through action. We remember what you did long after we forget what you said. ([Location 2471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=2471))

- The one question that every business buyer asks herself is, “What will I tell my boss?” You’re marketing the answer to that question: “If you choose this, you can tell your board/investors/boss that you . . .” The marketer who is out of ideas or energy finishes that sentence with, “. . . bought the cheapest one.” For the rest of us, there’s the opportunity to finish that sentence with a narrative about status, fear, affiliation, belonging, dominion, safety, commitment, insight, or any of the other emotions we’ve discussed.

- All thirteen of these principles get to the mission of the marketer. To engage with people and help them create the change they seek. To understand their worldviews and talk and act in ways that align with who they are and what they want. To connect people to one another in an infinite game of possibility.

- Who’s it for? What’s it for? What is the worldview of the audience you’re seeking to reach? What are they afraid of? What story will you tell? Is it true? What change are you seeking to make? How will it change their status? How will you reach the early adopters and neophiliacs? Why will they tell their friends? What will they tell their friends? Where’s the network effect that will propel this forward? What asset are you building? Are you proud of it? ([Location 3114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBR1V9S&location=3114))
