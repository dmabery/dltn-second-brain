## Highlights
1
- Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=202))
1
- Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=282))
1
- So, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep. [78] ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=289))
1
- Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=290))
1
- So, technology is the set of things, as Alan Kay said, that don’t quite work yet [correction: Danny Hillis]. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=295))
1
- Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=309))
1
- Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=320))
1
- Society, business, & money are downstream of technology, which is itself downstream of science. Science applied is the engine of humanity. Corollary: Applied Scientists are the most powerful people in the world. This will be more obvious in the coming years. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=328))
1
- Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=342))
1
- If you’re not 100 percent into it, somebody else who is 100 percent into it will outperform you. And they won’t just outperform you by a little bit—they’ll outperform you by a lot because now we’re operating the domain of ideas, compound interest really applies and leverage really applies. [78] ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=345))
1
- The internet enables any niche interest, as long as you’re the best person at it to scale out. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=350))

1
- If you go to the library and there’s a book you cannot understand, you have to dig down and say, “What is the foundation required for me to learn this?” Foundations are super important. [74] ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=364))
1
- When you find the right thing to do, when you find the right people to work with, invest deeply. Sticking with it for decades is really how you make the big returns in your relationships and in your money. So, compound interest is very important. [10] ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=390))
1
- I say this because you should be very thoughtful and realize in most things (relationships, work, even in learning) what you’re trying to do is find the thing you can go all-in on to earn compound interest. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=401))
1
- What I’m saying is: when you find the 1 percent of your discipline which will not be wasted, which you’ll be able to invest in for the rest of your life and has meaning to you—go all-in and forget about the rest. [10] ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=407))
1
- Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=411))
1
- I’m most familiar with Silicon Valley, but generally, people will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made a high-integrity effort. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=430))
1

1
- Probably the most interesting thing to keep in mind about new forms of leverage is they are permissionless. They don’t require somebody else’s permission for you to use them or succeed. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=508))
1
- If you have independence and you’re accountable on your output, as opposed to your input—that’s the dream. [10] ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=515))
1
- Inputs don’t match outputs, especially for leveraged workers. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=525))
1

1
- We waste our time with short-term thinking and busywork. Warren Buffett spends a year deciding and a day acting. That act lasts decades. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=611))
1
- It’s more about consistently creating wealth by creating businesses, creating opportunities, and creating investments. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=619))
1
- What are one or two steps you’d take to surround yourself with successful people? Figure out what you’re good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=685))
1
- I would rather be a failed entrepreneur than someone who never tried. Because even a failed entrepreneur has the skill set to make it on their own. [14] ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=702))
1

1
- Apply specific knowledge with leverage and eventually, you will get what you deserve. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=832))
1
- If you want to make the maximum amount of money possible, if you want to get rich over your life in a deterministically predictable way, stay on the bleeding edge of trends and study technology, design, and art—become really good at something. [1] ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=869))
1
- My definition of wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment. They’re highly linked; knowing the long-term consequences of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on that. [78] ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=876))
1
- The direction you’re heading in matters more than how fast you move, especially with leverage. Picking the direction you’re heading in for every decision is far, far more important than how much force you apply. Just pick the right direction to start walking in, and start walking. [1] ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=880))
1

1
- If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you’re lost. You’re just memorizing. [4] ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=892))
1
- The number one thing clouding us from being able to see reality is we have preconceived notions of the way it should be. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=898))
1
- The smaller you can make your ego, the less conditioned you can make your reactions, the less desires you can have about the outcome you want, the easier it will be to see the reality. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=905))
1
- Suffering is the moment when we can no longer deny reality. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=907))
1
- The problem is their desire is colliding with reality and preventing them from seeing the truth, no matter how much you say ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=912))

1
- It’s only after you’re bored you have the great ideas. It’s never going to be when you’re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time. [7] ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=922))
1
- Very smart people tend to be weird since they insist on thinking everything through for themselves. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=925))
1
- A contrarian isn’t one who always objects—that’s a conformist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently from the ground up and resists pressure to conform. Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=927))
1
- “Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.” ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=933))
1
- It’s really important to be able to uncondition yourself, to be able to take your habits apart and say, “Okay, this is a habit I probably picked up when I was a toddler trying to get my parent’s attention. Now I’ve reinforced it and reinforced it, and I call it a part of my identity. Does it still serve me? Does it make me happier? Does it make me healthier? Does it make me accomplish whatever I set out to accomplish?” ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=936))
1
- I try not to have too much I’ve pre-decided. I think creating identities and labels locks you in and keeps you from seeing the truth. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=942))
1
- If all your beliefs line up into neat little bundles, you should be highly suspicious. ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=946))
1
- There are two attractive lessons about suffering in the long term. It can make you accept the world the way it is. The other lesson is it can make your ego change in an extremely hard way. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=949))
1
- There are no permanent solutions in a dynamic system. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=953))
1
- If you have a criticism of someone, then don’t criticize the person—criticize the general approach or criticize the class of activities. ([Location 969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=969))
1
- Charisma is the ability to project confidence and love at the same time. It’s almost always possible to be honest and positive. [71] ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=973))
1
- Mental models are really just compact ways for you to recall your own knowledge. [78] ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=993))
1
- I don’t believe I have the ability to say what is going to work. Rather, I try to eliminate what’s not going to work. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=999))
1
- When you are the principal, then you are the owner—you care, and you will do a great job. When you are the agent and you are doing it on somebody else’s behalf, you can do a bad job. You just don’t care. You optimize for yourself rather than for the principal’s assets. ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1013))
1
- If it doesn’t make falsifiable predictions, it’s not science. For you to believe something is true, it should have predictive power, and it must be falsifiable. [11] ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1038))
1
- Simple heuristic: If you’re evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1055))

1
- Reading a book isn’t a race—the better the book, the more slowly it should be absorbed. ([Location 1088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1088))
1
- If you’re a perpetual learning machine, you will never be out of options for how to make money. You can always see what’s coming up in society, what the value is, where the demand is, and you can learn to come up to speed. [74] ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1150))
1
- When solving problems: the older the problem, the older the solution. ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1172))

1
- To me, happiness is not about positive thoughts. It’s not about negative thoughts. It’s about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. ([Location 1212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1212))
1

1
- However, if you view yourself as a bacteria or an amoeba—or if you view all of your works as writing on water or building castles in the sand, then you have no expectation for how life should “actually” be. Life is just the way it is. When you accept that, you have no cause to be happy or unhappy. Those things almost don’t apply. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1230))
1
- You can literally destroy your happiness if you spend all of your time living in delusions of the future. [4] ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1263))
1
- I try not to have more than one big desire in my life at any given time, and I also recognize it as the axis of my suffering. I realize the area where I’ve chosen to be unhappy. [5] ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1307))

1
- Many distinctions between people who get happier as they get older and people who don’t can be explained by what habits they have developed. ([Location 1411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1411))
1
- A personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest? [11] ([Location 1452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1452))
