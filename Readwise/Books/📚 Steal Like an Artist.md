- You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=69))
1
- Your job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=81))

- Filmmaker John Waters has said, “Nothing is more important than an unread library.” ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=105))
1
- If I’d waited to know who I was or what I was about before I started “being creative,” well, I’d still be sitting around trying to figure myself out instead of making things. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=124))

- 1. Pretend to be something you’re not until you are—fake it until you’re successful, until everybody sees you the way you want them to; or 2. Pretend to be making something until you actually make something. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=142))
1
- love both readings—you have to dress for the job you want, not the job you have, and you have to start doing the work you want to be doing. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=145))
1
- Creative work is a kind of theater. The stage is your studio, your desk, or your workstation. The costume is your outfit—your painting pants, your business suit, or that funny hat that helps you think. The props are your materials, your tools, and your medium. The script is just plain old time. An hour here, or an hour there—just time measured out for things to happen. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=154))
1
- Copying is about reverse-engineering. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=163))

- As Salvador Dalí said, “Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.” ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=169))
1
- Wilson Mizner said if you copy from one author, it’s plagiarism, but if you copy from many, it’s research. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=173))
1
- Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=176))
1
- If you just mimic the surface of somebody’s work without understanding where they are coming from, your work will never be anything more than a knockoff. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=179))
1
- Emulation is when imitation goes one step further, breaking through into your own thing. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=185))

- So: Copy your heroes. Examine where you fall short. What’s in there that makes you different? That’s what you should amplify and transform into your own work. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=196))
1
- Transforming their work into something of your own is how you flatter them. Adding something to the world that only you can add. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=198))
1
- When we love a piece of work, we’re desperate for more. We crave sequels. Why not channel that desire into something productive? ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=224))
1
- The manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use—do the work you want to see done. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=229))

- Try it: If you have the space, set up two workstations, one analog and one digital. For your analog station, keep out anything electronic. Take $10, go to the school supply aisle of your local store, and pick up some paper, pens, and sticky notes. When you get back to your analog station, pretend it’s craft time. Scribble on paper, cut it up, and tape the pieces back together. Stand up while you’re working. Pin things on the walls and look for patterns. Spread things around your space and sort through them. Once you start getting your ideas, then you can move over to your digital station and use the computer to help you execute and publish them. When you start to lose steam, head back to the analog station and play. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=274))

- Don’t worry about unity—what unifies your work is the fact that you made it. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=315))
1
- Do good work and share it with people. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=334))
1
- The more open you are about sharing your passions, the closer people will feel to your work. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=341))
1
- You don’t put yourself online only because you have something to say—you can put yourself online to find something to say. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=348))
1
- “Complain about the way other people make software by making software.” ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=438))

- “Modern art = I could do that + Yeah, but you didn’t.” ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=453))

- “Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.” —Gustave Flaubert ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=472))
