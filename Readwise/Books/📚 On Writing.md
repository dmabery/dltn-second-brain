## Highlights
1
- There is no Idea Dump, no Story Central, no Island of the Buried Bestsellers; good story ideas seem to come quite literally from nowhere, sailing at you right out of the empty sky: two previously unrelated ideas come together and make something new under the sun. Your job isn’t to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=314))
1
- When you’re still too young to shave, optimism is a perfectly legitimate response to failure. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=355))
1
- Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1181))

- “Yeah, but Stevie,” he said, bending to grasp the handles, “I didn’t know what else I might find to do once I got out here, did I? It’s best to have your tools with you. If you don’t, you’re apt to find something you didn’t expect and get discouraged.” ([Location 1224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1224))
1
- I want to suggest that to write to your best abilities, it behooves you to construct your own toolbox and then build up enough muscle so you can carry it with you. ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1226))
1
- Then, instead of looking at a hard job and getting discouraged, you will perhaps seize the correct tool and get immediately to work. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1227))
1
- The commonest of all, the bread of writing, is vocabulary. ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1233))
1
- Put your vocabulary on the top shelf of your toolbox, and don’t make any conscious effort to improve it. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1272))
1
- Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful. ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1280))
1
- British advertising man with a proper education can make magazine copy for ribbed condoms sound like the Magna goddam Carta), ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1304))
1
- Take any noun, put it with any verb, and you have a sentence. It never fails. Rocks explode. Jane transmits. Mountains float. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1323))
1
- Warriner’s English Grammar and Composition ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1332))
1
- The timid fellow writes The meeting will be held at seven o’clock because that somehow says to him, “Put it this way and people will believe you really know.” Purge this quisling thought! Don’t be a muggle! Throw back your shoulders, stick out your chin, and put that meeting in charge! Write The meeting’s at seven. There, by God! Don’t you feel better? ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1349))
1
- first kiss will always be recalled by me as how my romance with Shayna was begun. Oh, man—who farted, right? A simpler way to express this idea—sweeter and more forceful, as well—might be this: My romance with Shayna began with our first kiss. I’ll never forget it. ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1358))
1
- The adverb is not your friend. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1367))
1
- I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs, and I will shout it from the rooftops. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1378))
1
- I’m convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing. If one is writing for one’s own pleasure, ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1412))
1
- All I ask is that you do as well as you can, and remember that, while to write adverbs is human, to write he said or she said is divine. ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1429))
1
- always write Thomas’s bike and never Thomas’ bike ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1434))
1
- frags can also work beautifully to streamline narration, create clear images, and create tension as well as to vary the prose-line. ([Location 1494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1494))
1
- The object of fiction isn’t grammatical correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story  . . . . to make him/her forget, whenever possible, that he/she is reading a story at all. ([Location 1497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1497))
1
- I would argue that the paragraph, not the sentence, is the basic unit of writing—the place where coherence begins and words stand a chance of becoming more than mere words. ([Location 1506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1506))
1
- The first is that good writing consists of mastering the fundamentals (vocabulary, grammar, the elements of style) and then filling the third level of your toolbox with the right instruments. The second is that while it is impossible to make a competent writer out of a bad writer, and while it is equally impossible to make a great writer out of a good one, it is possible, with lots of hard work, dedication, and timely help, to make a good writer out of a merely competent one. ([Location 1554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1554))
1
- If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1590))
1
- You cannot hope to sweep someone else away by the force of your writing until it has been done to you. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1613))
1
- If you don’t have time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that. ([Location 1624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1624))
1
- Talent renders the whole idea of rehearsal meaningless; when you find something at which you are talented, you do it (whatever it is) until your fingers bleed or your eyes are ready to fall out of your head. ([Location 1655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1655))
1
- For me, not working is the real work. ([Location 1700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1700))
1
- Your job is to make sure the muse knows where you’re going to be every day from nine ‘til noon or seven ‘til three. If he does know, I assure you that sooner or later he’ll start showing up, chomping his cigar and making his magic. – ([Location 1751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1751))
1
- Now comes the big question: What are you going to write about? And the equally big answer: Anything you damn well want. Anything at all  . . . . as long as you tell the truth. ([Location 1755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1755))
1
- What you need to remember is that there’s a difference between lecturing about what you know and using it to enrich the story. The latter is good. The former is not. ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1798))
1
- In my view, stories and novels consist of three parts: narration, which moves the story from point A to point B and finally to point Z; description, which creates a sensory reality for the reader; and dialogue, which brings characters to life through their speech. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1820))
1
- I want you to understand that my basic belief about the making of stories is that they pretty much make themselves. The job of the writer is to give them a place to grow (and to transcribe them, of course). ([Location 1826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1826))
1
- my books tend to be based on situation rather than story. ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1840))
1
- Story is honorable and trustworthy; plot is shifty, and best kept under house arrest. ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1919))
1
- Description is what makes the reader a sensory participant in the story. ([Location 1965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1965))
1
- Description begins with visualization of what it is you want the reader to experience. It ends with your translating what you see in your mind into words on the page. ([Location 1968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1968))
1
- Thin description leaves the reader feeling bewildered and nearsighted. Overdescription buries him or her in details and images. ([Location 1973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1973))
1
- if I describe mine, it freezes out yours, ([Location 1981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1981))
1
- Description begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s. ([Location 1981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1981))
1
- For me, good description usually consists of a few well-chosen details that will stand for everything else. In most cases, these details will be the first ones that come to mind. ([Location 1988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1988))
1
- redolent ([Location 2012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2012))
2
    - Note: Strongly suggestive of something
1
- In many cases when a reader puts a story aside because it “got boring,” the boredom arose because the writer grew enchanted with his powers of description and lost sight of his priority, which is to keep the ball rolling. If ([Location 2024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2024))
1
- When it’s on target, a simile delights us in much the same way meeting an old friend in a crowd of strangers does. ([Location 2032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2032))
1
- The key to good description begins with clear seeing and ends with clear writing, the kind of writing that employs fresh images and simple vocabulary. ([Location 2048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2048))
1
- Practice the art, always reminding yourself that your job is to say what you see, and then to get on with your story. ([Location 2054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2054))
1
- one of the cardinal rules of good fiction is never tell us a thing if you can show us, instead: ([Location 2059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2059))
1
- you substitute “Oh sugar!” for “Oh shit!” because you’re thinking about the Legion of Decency, you are breaking the unspoken contract that exists between writer and reader—your promise to express the truth of how people act and talk through the medium of a made-up story. ([Location 2141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2141))
1
- Everything I’ve said about dialogue applies to building characters in fiction. The job boils down to two things: paying attention to how the real people around you behave and then telling the truth about what you see. ([Location 2179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2179))
1
- For me, what happens to characters as a story progresses depends solely on what I discover about them as I go along—how they grow, in other words. ([Location 2189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2189))
1
- I think the best stories always end up being about the people rather than the event, which is to say character-driven. ([Location 2192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2192))
1
- think that in the end, the story should always be the boss. ([Location 2194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2194))
1
- My job (and yours, if you decide this is a viable approach to storytelling) is to make sure these fictional folks behave in ways that will both help the story and seem reasonable to us, given what we know about them (and what we know about real life, of course). Sometimes villains feel self-doubt (as Greg Stillson does); sometimes they feel pity (as Annie Wilkes does). And sometimes the good guy tries to turn away from doing the right thing, as Johnny Smith does  . . . . as Jesus Christ himself did, if you think about that prayer (“take this cup from my lips”) in the Garden of Gethsemane. And if you do your job, your characters will come to life and start doing stuff on their own. I know that sounds a little creepy if you haven’t actually experienced it, but it’s terrific fun when it happens. And it will solve a lot of your problems, believe me. ([Location 2252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2252))
1
- that practice is invaluable (and should feel good, really not like practice at all) and that honesty is indispensable. ([Location 2259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2259))
1
- Skills in description, dialogue, and character development all boil down to seeing or hearing clearly and then transcribing what you see or hear with equal clarity (and without using a lot of tiresome, unnecessary adverbs). ([Location 2260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2260))
1
- You can’t please all of the readers all of the time; you can’t please even some of the readers all of the time, but you really ought to try to please at least some of the readers some of the ([Location 2274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2274))
1
- None of the bells and whistles are about story, all right? Only story is about story. ([Location 2321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2321))
1
- Not every book has to be loaded with symbolism, irony, or musical language (they call it prose for a reason, y’know), but it seems to me that every book—at least every one worth reading—is about something. ([Location 2333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2333))
1
- Your job during or just after the first draft is to decide what something or somethings yours is about. Your job in the second draft—one of them, anyway—is to make that something even more clear. This may necessitate some big changes and revisions. The benefits to you and your reader will be clearer focus and a more unified story. It hardly ever fails. ([Location 2334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2334))
1
- the question of why, if there is a God, such terrible things happen (The Stand, Desperation, The Green Mile); ([Location 2420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2420))
1
- They are questions that occupy my mind when I turn out the lights for the night and I’m alone with myself, looking up into the darkness with one hand tucked beneath the pillow. ([Location 2425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2425))
1
- Good fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme; it almost never begins with theme and progresses to story. ([Location 2431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2431))
1
- Probably not true, but remember this: someone really did design the Titanic and then label it unsinkable. ([Location 2495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2495))
1
- Call that one person you write for Ideal Reader. He or she is going to be in your writing room all the time: ([Location 2572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2572))
1
- (kill your darlings, kill your darlings, even when it breaks your egocentric little scribbler’s heart, kill your darlings). ([Location 2616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2616))
1
- “Not bad, but PUFFY. You need to revise for length. Formula: 2nd Draft = 1st Draft – 10%. Good luck.” ([Location 2622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2622))
1
- Back story is all the stuff that happened before your tale began but which has an impact on the front story. ([Location 2637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2637))
1
- You’ve probably heard the phrase in medias res, which means “into the midst of things.” ([Location 2646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2646))
1
- As a reader, I’m a lot more interested in what’s going to happen than what already did. ([Location 2651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2651))
1
- You need to listen very carefully to the things I.R. didn’t understand, and then ask yourself if you understand them. If you do and just didn’t put those parts across, your job on the second draft is to clarify. ([Location 2664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2664))
1
- about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don’t get carried away with the rest. ([Location 2683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2683))
1
- Just don’t end up with the tail wagging the dog; remember that you are writing a novel, not a research paper. The story always comes first. ([Location 2732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2732))
1
- is, after all, the dab of grit that seeps into an oyster’s shell that makes the pearl, not pearl-making seminars with other oysters. ([Location 2752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2752))
1
- America has never much revered her creative people; as a whole, we’re more interested in commemorative plates from the Franklin Mint and Internet greeting-cards. And if you don’t like it, it’s a case of tough titty said the kitty, ‘cause that’s just the way things are. Americans are a lot more interested in TV quiz shows than in the short fiction of Raymond Carver. ([Location 2798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2798))
1
- You learn best by reading a lot and writing a lot, and the most valuable lessons of all are the ones you teach yourself. ([Location 2810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2810))
1
- but it would certainly be a grand time, and grand times are something I’m always in favor of. ([Location 2816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2816))
1
- Writer’s Market, the most valuable of tools for the writer new to the marketplace. ([Location 2845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2845))

- Writer’s Digest and The Writer, ([Location 2869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2869))
1
- When you send your story out, there ought to be a very brief cover-letter on top of the script, telling the editor where you’ve published other stories and just a line or two on what this one’s about. And you should close by thanking him for the reading. That’s especially important. “You should submit on a good grade of white bond paper—none of that slippery erasable stuff. ([Location 2908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2908))
1
- Your copy should be double-spaced, and on the first page you should put your address in the upper lefthand corner—it doesn’t hurt to include your telephone number, too. In the righthand corner, put an approximate word-count.” Frank pauses, laughs, and says: “Don’t cheat, either. Most magazine editors can tell how long a story is just by looking at the print and riffling the pages.” ([Location 2911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2911))
1
- “You can’t make them like your story,” Frank finishes, “but you can at least make it easy for them to try to like it.” ([Location 2918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2918))
1
- I have done some work as favors for friends—logrolling is the slang term for it—but ([Location 2977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2977))

- And if you can do it for joy, you can do it forever. ([Location 2980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2980))
1
- Writing is not life, but I think that sometimes it can be a way back to life. ([Location 2981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2981))
1
- The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better. ([Location 3192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=3192))

- it makes my life a brighter and more pleasant place. ([Location 3202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=3202))
1
- In the end, it’s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life, as well. ([Location 3203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=3203))
