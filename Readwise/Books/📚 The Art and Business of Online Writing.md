## Highlights
1
- By writing online, you elevate yourself. And when you elevate yourself, you open new doors of opportunity. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=378))
1
- Sharing thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights on a platform that already has an active audience. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=441))
1
- There are 2 types of writers today: those who use data to inform and improve their writing, and those who fail. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=542))
1
- Your “Writing Data Flywheel” is a mechanism for endless inspiration. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=601))
1
- Another way of saying this would be “intentionally” vs “unintentionally.” ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=688))
1
- Successful writers play the game of Online Writing consciously. Unsuccessful writers play the game unconsciously—and then wonder why they aren’t succeeding. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=694))
1
- A category is a frame, a bucket, a spot on the shelf where similar objects reside. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=720))
1
- Categories are how we organize information in our minds. Know your category and you’ll know where readers “fit” you into their own minds. ([Location 728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=728))
1
- As you begin to play the game of online writing consciously, the next big question you have to ask yourself is which side of the fence are you going to play on? Are you a non-fiction writer? Or are you a fiction writer? Are you an educational writer, where your mission is to inform and explain? Or are you an entertainment writer, where your mission is to captivate and entertain? ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=746))
1
- The more unexpected the style, in the context of your category, the more likely you are to stand out. On the other hand, the more expected the style, in the context of your category, the more likely you are to sound like everyone else—and blend into the noise. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=753))
1
- The secret to creating a unique writing style is by doing what would be considered “unexpected” in your chosen category. ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=758))
1
- My teachers in college called this, “The Rate of Revelation.” This is the rate at which you reveal new information to the reader—and new information is what keeps people interested. ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=790))
1
- But the real reason it “wins” is because its Rate of Revelation is so much higher. Every single sentence advances the “story” to the next main point. And on the internet, this level of velocity is crucial to hooking and keeping a reader’s attention. ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=824))
1
- The point is to understand that the internet moves fast, and then reflect on the role “speed” can play in your writing style, in the context of your chosen category. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=828))
1
- The inverse rule of “Specificity is the Secret,” is “The Broader You Are, The More Confusing You Are.” ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=846))
1
- Ineffective writing is nothing more than writing that does not resonate. ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=857))
1
- This is what I mean when I say “Good” and “Bad” are unproductive ways of looking at writing. The real question you should never stop asking yourself is, “Could this be more specific?” Because the more specific you can be, the more likely you are to resonate with your target reader MORE than your competition. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=890))
1
- If someone comes across your article or song or video and it’s so much “Better” than the vast majority of other creators in your category, they don’t need to read your bio or take a look at your accolades to know whether or not you’re someone credible. ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=919))
1
- Remember, Specificity Is The Secret. The more specific you are, the more likely a reader is going to immediately assume they are in the right place, reading the right writer for them. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=938))
1
- Whether we realize it or not, the reason we choose to pay attention to some people and choose not to pay attention to other people is not because of Perceived Credibility. It’s really not their fancy titles, badges of approval, or press logos that attract us into their vortex. It’s actually their Implied Credibility (quality of content) and Earned Credibility (proof they’re “playing and winning the game”). ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=985))
1
- What makes a badge of credibility valuable isn’t really the badge itself. It’s how the writer chooses to wear it. ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1011))
1
- Credibility is in the eye of the beholder—and it’s a ladder anyone can climb. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1022))
1
- They set out to try to be a “Better” version of a writer within an existing category, instead of creating a new and “DIFFERENT” category altogether. ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1069))
1
- Categories are created at unlikely intersections, spotted by writers with an intimate understanding of one or multiple sub-categories. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1076))
1
- “The number of hours I spend consuming should never equal or exceed the number of hours I spend creating.” ([Location 1492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1492))
1
- The more you write, the more data you will accumulate, the better your skills will get, the faster you will learn. ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1503))
1
- The writers who become successful aren’t necessarily the most talented writers. The writers who become successful are the most consistent writers. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1545))
1
- In your first six months of writing online, you should be less concerned with “establishing” yourself and more focused on “discovering” yourself. ([Location 1594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1594))
1
- Question everything. Nothing a creator does repeatedly is accidental. ([Location 1649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1649))
1
- Consistent output is the secret to every growth metric on the internet: views, comments, Likes, shares, etc. ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1691))
1
- The way you “win” the game of online writing is by creating the single best possible version of whatever form of writing you’re using in your chosen category. ([Location 1921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1921))
1
- “Can I make this more specific? Am I trying to cram too much into one article?” ([Location 1937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1937))
1
- “Better” Quality: If everyone else writes short guides that don’t go into very much detail, you can be the one to write long, insightful, walkthrough-style guides. Conversely, if everyone else writes long, boring, walkthrough-style guides, you can be the one to condense them into shorter, more digestible bites. “Better” Voice: If everyone else’s How To guides are dense and overwhelming, you can show up to the party and be fast, full of personality, and overly casual. Conversely, if everyone else’s How To guides are so casual you feel as though you aren’t being given professional insight, you can be the one to write in a more formal way. “Better” Organization: If everyone else writes really great material, but it’s organized poorly and full of huge paragraphs and no subheads or page breaks for the reader, you can win simply by organizing your writing more visually and “appearing” easier to read and understand. “Better” Positioned: If everyone else is writing about the same problem, you can flip the problem on its head to be seen as something radically different. For example, if there are a million guides all titled “How To Get Your First Client As A Freelance Photographer,” you can position yourself differently by reframing the problem: “Freelance Photographers, Here’s Why You Don’t Want To Charge Your First Client Any Money At All.” “Better” For The Audience: If everyone else is writing about their industry from a broad perspective, you can stand out by choosing not to use universal language and using extremely specific terminology and vernacular only that specific audience would understand—and vice versa, if everyone else writes exclusively for the niche, you can stand out by writing for a broader, more universal audience. “Better” Experience: If everyone else writes as if they are trying to hard-sell readers into buying a product or course, only giving them 10% of the information they actually need and hoping they’ll pay for the other 90%, you can stand out by giving away that same information (and then some) for free. Opinion Opinion pieces are, without question, the most popular type of written content on the internet. Unfortunately, because opinions are so easy to write and share, they are also least likely to stand out because, well, everyone has one. The reason certain opinions go unheard is because the people writing them think that “just having an opinion” is the most important measure of success. It’s not. Opinions, just like Actionable Guides, have their own set of rules—and if you want to avoid being another navel-gazing blogger nobody cares to listen to, you need to find different ways to communicate in order to stand out. The techniques listed above for Actionable Guides work well for Opinions, Curated Lists, Stories, and Credibility pieces, so I won’t repeat them. Below are additional techniques that work well for Opinion writing. “Better” Data: If everyone else’s opinions are shot from the hip and aren’t backed by anything… ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1959))
1
- In order for your list to not be clickbait, bandut to actually be meaningful and valuable to a reader, you need two things: Specificity and Speed. ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2007))
1
- I’m interested in (as a reader) is 1) which books, and 2) a quick summary of what each book is about so I can determine which ones I want to read first. Anything beyond that is unnecessary, and not why a reader is reading this list in the first place. ([Location 2017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2017))
1
- “Better” Examples: If everyone else is using cliché examples—Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Tiger Woods—you can differentiate yourself by using lesser known, more unconventional examples specifically from seemingly irrelevant categories. ([Location 2029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2029))
1
- Reframing a topic is a powerful way of communicating to readers that you know something most other people in your chosen category do not. ([Location 2107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2107))
1
- The Curiosity Gap is what tells the reader what this piece of writing is about, who it’s for, and what it’s promising—all without revealing the answer. ([Location 2126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2126))
1
- For example, a headline like “The Big Idea” is ineffective because it doesn’t tell the reader 1) what it’s about, 2) who it’s for, or 3) what it’s promising in exchange. ([Location 2131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2131))
1
- “Play Bigger: How Pirates, Dreamers, And Innovators Create And Dominate Markets” ([Location 2163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2163))
1
- What is this about? Is this for me? What PROMISE are you making—and how confident am I in your ability to deliver on that PROMISE? ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2173))
1
- The first question I encourage you to ask yourself is, “Who is this piece of writing for?” ([Location 2185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2185))
1
- What does being a “better writer” really mean? What benefits do you receive by becoming a better writer? Why should someone want to become a “better writer” in the first place? ([Location 2214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2214))
1
- Titles that only answer 1 of the 3 questions are weak. Titles that answer 2 of the 3 questions are good. Titles that answer all 3 of the questions are exceptional ([Location 2238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2238))
1
- subconsciously feel like the headline lacks clarity—and when you confuse, you lose. ([Location 2262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2262))
1
- The two things you need to balance here are: WHO—based on age, ethnicity, location, interest, etc. WHO within that WHO—all of them? Some of them? 1% of them? ([Location 2278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2278))
1
- The best way to come up with a compelling PROMISE is to think deeply about 1) outcomes your readers want to receive, or 2) outcomes your readers want to avoid. ([Location 2285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2285))
1
- “…Become Rich” is a good outcome, but “…Become So Rich You Never Have To Think About Money Again” is a far more emotional and exciting outcome. “…Not Lose Your Job” is a general outcome most people want to avoid, but “…Not Get Fired On Your First Day” is a more specific, more easily imaginable outcome ([Location 2286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2286))
1
- “…Get Married” is a standard outcome, but “…Get Married And Stay Together For More Than 20 Years” is an outcome the reader can measure. ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2290))
1
- The more emotional you can make your PROMISE, the more likely a reader is to want to read, comment, and share your writing. ([Location 2291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2291))
1
- Here are some of the most proven headline formats in online writing: ([Location 2299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2299))

1
- Credible Names: ([Location 2306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2306))
1
- “This Just Happened”: ([Location 2310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2310))
1
- Timeliness is a terrific mechanism for getting readers’ attention right now. Words like “Just, Recently, Today, Now,” etc., are what tell a reader that of all the things on the internet to read, “this thing” is high priority. ([Location 2310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2310))
1
- The Success Story: ([Location 2314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2314))
1
- Things That Shouldn’t Go Together: ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2317))
1
- For The Industry: ([Location 2320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2320))

- The Topic Within The Topic: ([Location 2323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2323))
1
- Question/Answer: ([Location 2327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2327))
1
- “Can’t Be Productive In The Office? Try Organizing Your Calendar Like This” or “Don’t Know How To Track Your Goals? This New App Has The Answer.” ([Location 2329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2329))
1
- BuzzFeed has a rule: every writer must write 30 versions of a headline in order to find the right one. ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2337))
1
- The first headline you write probably won’t be “it.” There’s a rewriting process that needs to happen in order to get rid of all the tiny words like “if, when, does, it, too, for,” etc., that get in the way of your headline achieving all three of its goals: 1) telling the reader what this piece is about, 2) whether it’s for them, and 3) whether the PROMISE is worth their time. ([Location 2339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2339))
1
- The way I write and rewrite headlines is I first try to say whatever it is I’m trying to say, in as many words as I need to say it. “The 8 Things You Should Do On A Daily Basis In Order To Become The Best Person You Can Possibly Become, No Matter What Obstacles Are In Your Way” ([Location 2342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2342))
1
- If you are a nonfiction writer, then I strongly encourage you to use these techniques in your online writing. Once you learn the formats, you’ll start to see them everywhere—from Medium articles to New York Times headlines. ([Location 2358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2358))
1
- If you want to write a sci-fi book, you should be writing articles online like, “8 Timeless Sci-Fi Characters That Defined The Genre Forever.” ([Location 2363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2363))
1
- POWER Phrases Lastly, you always want to be thinking about what “POWER phrases” you can add to your headlines to clarify the urgency and importance of whatever it is you’re writing about. ([Location 2366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2366))
1
- For example, instead of saying “7 Ways…” you could say, “7 Little-Known Ways” or “7 Small But Powerful Ways.” ([Location 2368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2368))

- This 1 Eye-Opening Takeaway From The 2019 TED Conference Will Inspire You To Be The Next Success Story In Your Industry ([Location 2376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2376))
1
- Section 1: Introduction Section 2: X Main Points Section 3: Conclusion ([Location 2390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2390))
1
- Right away in the introduction, your job is to answer all three of the reader’s preliminary questions: What is this about? Is this for me? What are you PROMISING me and how confident am I that you’re going to deliver on that PROMISE? ([Location 2400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2400))
1
- “Most people don’t believe me when I say I write 10,000 words per day, every day.” This is the first sentence of my viral article, “How I Write 10,000 Words Per Day, Every Day.” “Success doesn’t happen in an instant.” This is the first sentence of my viral article, “There are only 2 ways to become rich.” This is the first sentence of my viral article, “The 1 Habit That Keeps 99% Of People From Ever Becoming Rich.” ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2407))
1
- In 1/3/1, you have one strong opening sentence, three description sentences, and then one conclusion sentence. Visually, this is a powerful way to tell the reader you aren’t going to make them suffer through big blocks of text, and that you have their best interests in mind. ([Location 2421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2421))
1
- This first sentence is your opener. This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence rounds out your argument, guiding the reader toward your conclusion. This fifth sentence is your strong conclusion. ([Location 2424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2424))
1
- The last sentence of the 1/3/1 article should be both a conclusion and a transition into the next section of the article—your Main Points. ([Location 2445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2445))
1
- The 1/5/1 structure is the same as the 1/3/1 structure, just with more room for description and clarification in the middle. ([Location 2449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2449))
1
- This first sentence is your opener. This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. This fourth sentence builds on that credibility or description, giving added context or new information. This fifth sentence explains to the reader why you’re telling them what you’re telling them. And this sixth sentence drives home the point. This seventh sentence is your strong conclusion. ([Location 2452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2452))
1
- You want to use the 1/5/1 structure when your opener would benefit from additional context, or you want to tell a story that requires an extra sentence or two for clarification. ([Location 2457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2457))
1
- A 1/3/1 or 1/5/1 opener = easy to read. ([Location 2474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2474))
1
- Remember: you want to optimize for speed and Rate of Revelation. Anything that isn’t absolutely necessary, delete it. ([Location 2481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2481))
1
- Notice, we are still keeping one single sentence as the opener, and one single sentence as the conclusion. This is to visually tell the reader, “You already read the first sentence, now there’s just this one big paragraph and then you can already see the conclusion sentence waiting for you.” When readers can “see” the end, they’re more likely to want to put in the effort to get there. ([Location 2491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2491))
1
- Written content online with no subheads feels exhausting. Lists with a lot of subheads, on the other hand, feel easy and convenient. ([Location 2578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2578))
1
- The key here isn’t to just list things for listing’s sake, but to think about what would otherwise take five or more sentences to write out, and to communicate that same information faster in a bulleted list. ([Location 2584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2584))
1
- Your job isn’t to just “list” stuff. It’s to take what otherwise would be a long-winded section and compress it using a different form or technique. ([Location 2597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2597))
1
- The types of introduction structures that work well are: 1/3/1 1/5/1 1/3/2/1 1/5/2/1 1/4/1/1 1/3/1 + 1/3/1 1/3/Subhead/3/1 1/3/1 + Bulleted List 1/Subhead ([Location 2635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2635))
1
- Notice again how every single structure relies on a single opening sentence, and always ends with a single conclusion sentence. ([Location 2639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2639))
1
- Pieces that open with two consecutive sentences in the first paragraph are weaker. And pieces that open with three or more sentences in the first paragraph are tiring for the reader. ([Location 2640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2640))

- As much as possible, you want to crescendo and decrescendo your rhythms, starting with one sentence, then moving up to three, four, or five sentences, then back down to two sentences, then back down to one—and repeat. ([Location 2641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2641))

- If the “sweet spot” of an online article is 800 to 1,200 words, then your job as a writer is to pack as much value into your Main Points as possible— without inflating the piece’s word count. ([Location 2651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2651))
1
- Once you’ve written your introduction (or, even before you write your introduction), skeleton out your piece by listing your Main Points. If you are writing an Opinion article, your Main Points are most likely going to be sentences and statements. If you are writing an Actionable Guide, your Main Points are going to be either sentences or categories. And if you are writing a Curated List, your Main Points are going to be the things you are listing: habits, lessons, movies, book titles, etc. ([Location 2655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2655))
1
- For example, here are the Main Points of my Opinion article, “Smart People Aren’t Born Smart. They Do This, And Become Smart As A Result.” Smart People Read (a lot). Smart people hang around other smart people. Smart people love making mistakes. Smart people see value in all types of knowledge. Smart people work (very, very) hard.

- 1/2/5/3/1 For articles that have three or less Main Points, you are going to want to use a structure that doesn’t cut your explanations too short. ([Location 2673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2673))
1
- The 1/2/5/3/1 structure is a good framework to use when thinking about how to make a solid argument for whatever it is you’re writing about, without getting “lost in the sauce” and rambling on and on. ([Location 2674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2674))
1
- This first sentence is your opener. This second sentence clarifies your opener. And this third sentence is why the reader should care. This fourth sentence starts to expand on the point. This fifth sentence is a story, or some sort of credible piece of insight. This sixth sentence builds on that story or insight and tells the reader something they maybe didn’t know. This seventh sentence is a small conclusion. And this eighth sentence is why that conclusion matters. This ninth sentence recaps what you just told the reader. This tenth sentence reinforces the argument you’re making with an additional tidbit or insight. And this eleventh sentence drives the point home. This twelfth sentence reminds the reader of the important takeaway. ([Location 2677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2677))
1
- If anything, you want to always be thinking the opposite for online writing. You should be asking yourself, “How can I make this shorter? How can I make this faster? How can I require less of the reader’s time?” ([Location 2727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2727))
1
- This first sentence is your opener. This second sentence clarifies your opener. And this third sentence is why the reader should care. This fourth sentence is your mini conclusion. This fifth sentence is why that mini conclusion matters specifically to your target reader. ([Location 2733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2733))

1
- But what you have to remember is that for pieces that have five or more Main Points, the whole reason why a reader is there is because they want to know the Main Points themselves—not necessarily a dissertation on each one. ([Location 2750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2750))
1
- The 1/1/1+ structure is a mechanism you should use for very specific sections within your writing—specifically beginnings and endings of sections. ([Location 2764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2764))
1
- Single sentences are great for calling out individual ideas, statements, or descriptions, and doing so several times in a row can elicit a powerful response in a reader. ([Location 2765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2765))
1
- This first sentence is a strong statement. This second sentence builds on, reinforces, or repeats that strong statement. This third sentence builds on, reinforces, or repeats that strong statement. ([Location 2767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2767))
1
- So, crescendo with the 1/1/1+ rhythm, and then decrescendo with a three, four, or even five-sentence paragraph. Then repeat. ([Location 2786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2786))
1
- For example, I use this structure in my article, “20 Things Nobody Tells You About Growing Up.” Most people are scared of imagination They’ve disconnected with their inner child. They don’t feel they are “creative.” They like things “just the way they are.” Your dream doesn’t really matter to anyone else. Some people might take interest. Some may support you in your quest. But at the end of the day, nobody cares, or will ever care about your dream as much as you. Friends are relative to where you are in your life. Most friends only stay for a period of time — usually in reference to your current interest. But when you move on, or your priorities change, so too do the majority of your friends.

- First, you are being “too productive” the moment that your input becomes disproportionate to your output. ([Location 2941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2941))

- The second example of being “too productive” is when your productivity has a disproportionate impact on your quality of life. ([Location 2954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2954))

- Readers love checklists, action steps, quick recaps, small reminders, etc., so the more you can use these techniques to your advantage, the easier it will be for them to understand precisely what it is you’re trying to tell them. ([Location 3131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3131))

1
- The Golden Intersection puts the reader first. This piece is about their questions. This piece is about their wants and needs. This piece is about their desires. ([Location 3273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3273))

- Always bring things back to the reader’s wants, needs, and desires. At no point should your story or “for context” information equal or exceed the amount of time you spend talking about the reader. ([Location 3352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3352))

- For example, here are my three content buckets: General Audience: Life advice, personal development, and self-mastery as it relates to my own life experiences as a writer and entrepreneur (and previously as a bodybuilder and professional gamer). Niche Audience: Online writing advice, self-publishing, and content marketing. Company/Industry Audience: Thought leadership and personal branding, specifically for executives, founders, investors, etc. ([Location 3500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3500))

- Writing anything on the internet follows a fairly simple 3-step process. Step 1: What “Type” Of Writing Is This? Form #1: Actionable Guide Form #2: Opinion Form #3: Curated List Form #4: Story Form #5: Credibility Step 2: What “Idea” Am I Communicating Within This Piece Of Writing? Idea #1: Explanation (When/Where/How/What/Why Something Happens) Idea #2: Habits (To Achieve A Destination, Goal, Or State Of Being) Idea #3: Mistakes (Keeping You From Achieving A Destination, Goal, Or State Of Being) Idea #4: Lessons (Learned In Pursuit Of A Destination, Goal, Or State Of Being) Idea #5: Tips (That Can Help You In Your Own Pursuit Of A Destination, Goal, Or State Of Being) Idea #6: Stories (That Symbolize Or Explain Some Aspect Of The Pursuit Of A Destination, Goal, Or State Of Being) Idea #7: Timely Events (That Are Relevant To The Target Reader’s Knowledge, Awareness, Or Pursuit Of A Destination, Goal, Or State Of Being) If you notice, timely “this just happened” content is only one of seven types of ideas that are communicated in written content—and yet, writers disproportionately give them priority in their libraries. Instead, I recommend you give timely content the smallest allocation of your writing portfolio. Take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves, but invest the majority of your time in building timeless assets you will be able to repurpose and reuse (and will pay you dividends) years into the future. Step 3: Why Me? Credibility #1: “I am an expert on this topic. Here’s what I think.” Credibility #2: “I went out and talked to all the trusted experts on this topic. Here are all their insights and opinions in one place.” Credibility #3: “I’m just sharing my opinion, but my opinion is the most articulate one of all.” When you combine these three steps together, you suddenly get a very easy (and replicable) equation for consistently writing high-quality, high-performing content.

- Curated List x Mistakes x 7 Industry Experts (Credibility #2) = the outline of an article titled, “7 Founders Share Their Biggest Mistakes They Made Raising Money For Their First Startups” Credibility x Explanation (Why) x Expert (Credibility #1) = the outline of an article titled, “I Was A Professional World Of Warcraft Gamer As A Teenager. Here’s Why eSports Is Going To Become A Multi-Billion Dollar Industry” Opinion x Lessons x My Perspective (Credibility #3) = the outline of an article titled, “Our Country’s Economy Is Falling Apart.

- Lastly, every time you sit down to write, I encourage you to ask yourself these three questions: “Does this idea fall within one of my three content buckets?” (If not, what can you tweak so that it makes more sense in the context of your library?) “Will this piece stand the test of time?” (If not, what can you change to make it less timely and more timeless?) “Have I already written about this?” (If yes, how can you re-tell your same stories, insights, opinions, etc., in a way that gives the reader a new and different experience?) ([Location 3686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3686))

- Remember: repetition is how you reinforce who you are, what you know, and what life experiences are informing your writing, perspective, and unique point of view. ([Location 3701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3701))

- The best way to continue earning a reader’s loyalty is to direct them from a piece of written content they already find valuable, to a longer, more extensive resource they will want to bookmark forever. ([Location 3746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3746))

1
- Once you have a Pillar Piece written on a specific topic, you should then direct readers over and over again to this Pillar Piece in your relevant social content. This becomes your “Reader Acquisition Flywheel.” Write content in each of your three Content Buckets. Use data to decide which specific topic deserves its own Pillar Piece. Create a Pillar Piece on your website specific to one of your Content Buckets. Continue to write about that proven topic in social environments, and regularly link to that Pillar Piece in everything you write that is relevant.
