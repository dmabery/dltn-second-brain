- Why did only three of the smokejumpers survive? Physical fitness might have been a factor; the other two survivors managed to outrun the fire and reach the crest of the ridge. But Dodge prevailed because of his mental fitness. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=101))

- Yet in a turbulent world, there’s another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=106))
1
- At some point, you’ve probably heard that if you drop a frog in a pot of scalding hot water, it will immediately leap out. But if you drop the frog in lukewarm water and gradually raise the temperature, the frog will die. It lacks the ability to rethink the situation, and doesn’t realize the threat until it’s too late. I did some research on this popular story recently and discovered a wrinkle: it isn’t true. Tossed into the scalding pot, the frog will get burned badly and may or may not escape. The frog is actually better off in the slow-boiling pot: it will leap out as soon as the water starts to get uncomfortably warm. It’s not the frogs who fail to reevaluate. It’s us. Once we hear the story ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=131))

- Progress is impossible without change; and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. —George Bernard Shaw ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=257))
1
- The problem is that we live in a rapidly changing world, where we need to spend as much time rethinking as we do thinking. Rethinking is a skill set, but it’s also a mindset. We already have many of the mental tools we need. We just have to remember to get them out of the shed and remove the rust. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=277))
1
- we think and talk, we often slip into the mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=305))
1
- We go into preacher mode when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy: we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=307))
1
- We enter prosecutor mode when we recognize flaws in other people’s reasoning: we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=307))
1
- We shift into politician mode when we’re seeking to win over an audience: we campaign and lobby for the approval of our constituents. The risk is that we become so wrapped up in preaching that we’re right, prosecuting others who are wrong, and politicking for support that we don’t bother to rethink our own views. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=308))
1
- But being a scientist is not just a profession. It’s a frame of mind—a mode of thinking that differs from preaching, prosecuting, and politicking. We move into scientist mode when we’re searching for the truth: we run experiments to test hypotheses and discover knowledge. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=326))
1
- That makes me wonder: is it possible to train people in other fields to think more like scientists, and if so, do they end up making smarter choices? ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=330))
1
- As the iPhone skyrocketed onto the scene, Mike maintained his belief in the features that had made the BlackBerry a sensation in the past. He was confident that people wanted a wireless device for work emails and calls, not an entire computer in their pocket with apps for home entertainment. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=368))
1
- No matter how much brainpower you have, if you lack the motivation to change your mind, you’ll miss many occasions to think again. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=380))
1
- The better you are at crunching numbers, the more spectacularly you fail at analyzing patterns that contradict your views. If ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=387))
1
- In psychology there are at least two biases that drive this pattern. One is confirmation bias: seeing what we expect to see. The other is desirability bias: seeing what we want to see. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=389))
1
- Being good at thinking can make you worse at rethinking. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=395))
1
- When we’re in scientist mode, we refuse to let our ideas become ideologies. We don’t start with answers or solutions; we lead with questions and puzzles. We don’t preach from intuition; we teach from evidence. We don’t just have healthy skepticism about other people’s arguments; we dare to disagree with our own arguments. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=396))
1
- It requires searching for reasons why we might be wrong—not for reasons why we must be right—and revising our views based on what we learn. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=399))
1
- In preacher mode, changing our minds is a mark of moral weakness; in scientist mode, it’s a sign of intellectual integrity. In prosecutor mode, allowing ourselves to be persuaded is admitting defeat; in scientist mode, it’s a step toward the truth. In politician mode, we flip-flop in response to carrots and sticks; in scientist mode, we shift in the face of sharper logic and stronger data. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=400))
1
- After all, the purpose of learning isn’t to affirm our beliefs; it’s to evolve our beliefs. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=409))
1
- Only one trait consistently predicted presidential greatness after controlling for factors like years in office, wars, and scandals. It wasn’t whether presidents were ambitious or forceful, friendly or Machiavellian; it wasn’t whether they were attractive, witty, poised, or polished. What set great presidents apart was their intellectual curiosity and openness. They read widely and were as eager to learn about developments in biology, philosophy, architecture, and music as in domestic and foreign affairs. They were interested in hearing new views and revising their old ones. They saw many of their policies as experiments to run, not points to score. Although they might have been politicians by profession, they often solved problems like scientists. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=417))
1
- Recognizing our shortcomings opens the door to doubt. As we question our current understanding, we become curious about what information we’re missing. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=427))
1
- If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=429))
1
- Pride breeds conviction rather than doubt, which makes us prosecutors: we might be laser-focused on changing other people’s minds, but ours is set in stone. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=432))
1
- In the case of the BlackBerry, Mike Lazaridis was trapped in an overconfidence cycle. Taking pride in his successful invention gave him too much conviction. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=437))
1
- Like a politician who campaigns only to his base, he focused on the keyboard taste of millions of existing users, neglecting the appeal of a touchscreen to billions of potential users. For ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=443))
1
- The solution is not to decelerate our thinking—it’s to accelerate our rethinking. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=449))
1
- ability to change his mind that really revived Apple. Although Jobs knew how to “think different,” it was his team that did much of the rethinking. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=453))
1
- Research shows that when people are resistant to change, it helps to reinforce what will stay the same. Visions for change are more compelling when they include visions of continuity. Although our strategy might evolve, our identity will endure. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=463))
1
- The curse of knowledge is that it closes our minds to what we don’t know. Good judgment depends on having the skill—and the will—to open our minds. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=474))
1
- Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge. —Charles Darwin ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=481))
1
- Anton’s syndrome—a deficit of self-awareness in which a person is oblivious to a physical disability but otherwise doing fairly well cognitively. It’s known to be caused by damage to the occipital lobe of the brain. Yet I’ve come to believe that even when our brains are functioning normally, we’re all vulnerable to a version of Anton’s syndrome. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=506))
2
    - Note: Antons Syndrome of Knowledge
1
- We all have blind spots in our knowledge and opinions. The bad news is that they can leave us blind to our blindness, which gives us false confidence in our judgment and prevents us from rethinking. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=508))
1
- In a meta-analysis of ninety-five studies involving over a hundred thousand people, women typically underestimated their leadership skills, while men overestimated their skills. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=539))
1
- You’ve probably met some football fans who are convinced they know more than the coaches on the sidelines. That’s the armchair quarterback syndrome, where confidence exceeds competence. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=540))
1
- The opposite of armchair quarterback syndrome is impostor syndrome, where competence exceeds confidence. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=545))
1
- The ideal level of confidence probably lies somewhere between being an armchair quarterback and an impostor. How do we find that sweet spot? ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=550))
1
- They had just published a “modest report” on skill and confidence that would soon become famous. They found that in many situations, those who can’t . . . don’t know they can’t. According to what’s now known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, it’s when we lack competence that we’re most likely to be brimming with overconfidence. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=559))
1
- The less intelligent we are in a particular domain, the more we seem to overestimate our actual intelligence in that domain. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=564))
1
- In a group of football fans, the one who knows the least is the most likely to be the armchair quarterback, prosecuting the coach for calling the wrong play and preaching about a better playbook. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=565))
1
- One of my biggest pet peeves is feigned knowledge, where people pretend to know things they don’t. It bothers me so much that at this very moment I’m writing an entire book about it. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=580))
1
- “The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don’t know you’re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club.” ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=584))
1
- There’s a less obvious force that clouds our vision of our abilities: a deficit in metacognitive skill, the ability to think about our thinking. Lacking competence can leave us blind to our own incompetence. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=604))
1
- When we lack the knowledge and skills to achieve excellence, we sometimes lack the knowledge and skills to judge excellence. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=610))
1
- Humility is often misunderstood. It’s not a matter of having low self-confidence. One of the Latin roots of humility means “from the earth.” It’s about being grounded—recognizing that we’re flawed and fallible. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=645))
1
- You can be confident in your ability to achieve a goal in the future while maintaining the humility to question whether you have the right tools in the present. That’s the sweet spot of confidence. We become blinded by arrogance when we’re utterly convinced of our strengths and our strategies. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=647))
1
- We get paralyzed by doubt when we lack conviction in both. We can be consumed by an inferiority complex when we know the right method but feel uncertain about our ability to execute it. What we want to attain is confident humility: having faith in our capability while appreciating that we may not have the right solution or even be addressing the right problem. That gives us enough doubt to reexamine our old knowledge and enough confidence to pursue new insights. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=649))
1
- Confident humility doesn’t just open our minds to rethinking—it improves the quality of our rethinking. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=662))
1
- The most effective leaders score high in both confidence and humility. Although they have faith in their strengths, they’re also keenly aware of their weaknesses. They know they need to recognize and transcend their limits if they want to push the limits of greatness. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=669))
1
- The first upside of feeling like an impostor is that it can motivate us to work harder. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=701))
1
- If we never worry about letting other people down, we’re more likely to actually do so. When we feel like impostors, we think we have something to prove. Impostors may be the last to jump in, but they may also be the last to bail out. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=705))
1
- Second, impostor thoughts can motivate us to work smarter. When we don’t believe we’re going to win, we have nothing to lose by rethinking our strategy. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=707))
1
- Third, feeling like an impostor can make us better learners. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=710))
1
- As psychologist Elizabeth Krumrei Mancuso and her colleagues write, “Learning requires the humility to realize one has something to learn.” ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=711))
1
- knowledge is best sought from experts, but creativity and wisdom can come from anywhere. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=734))
1
- They’re aware that each answer raises new questions, and the quest for knowledge is never finished. ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=742))

    - Note: Tweet this!
1
- Humility is a reflective lens: it helps us see them clearly. Confident humility is a corrective lens: it enables us to overcome those weaknesses. ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=744))
1
- The goal is not to be wrong more often. It’s to recognize that we’re all wrong more often than we’d like to admit, and the more we deny it, the deeper the hole we dig for ourselves. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=785))
1
- In a classic paper, sociologist Murray Davis argued that when ideas survive, it’s not because they’re true—it’s because they’re interesting. What makes an idea interesting is that it challenges our weakly held opinions. ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=798))
1
- When a core belief is questioned, though, we tend to shut down rather than open up. It’s as if there’s a miniature dictator living inside our heads, controlling the flow of facts to our minds, much like Kim Jong-un controls the press in North Korea. The technical term for this in psychology is the totalitarian ego, and its job is to keep out threatening information. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=804))

    - Note: Add this phrase to the notecRds
1
- First, our wrong opinions are shielded in filter bubbles, where we feel pride when we see only information that supports our convictions. Then our beliefs are sealed in echo chambers, where we hear only from people who intensify and validate them. Although the resulting fortress can appear impenetrable, there’s a growing community of experts who are determined to break through. ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=830))
1
- he genuinely enjoys discovering that he was wrong, because it means he is now less wrong than before. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=841))
1
- As Danny told me, “Being wrong is the only way I feel sure I’ve learned anything.” ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=847))
1
- When I asked him how he stays in that mode, he said he refuses to let his beliefs become part of his identity. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=849))
1
- Attachment. That’s what keeps us from recognizing when our opinions are off the mark and rethinking them. To unlock the joy of being wrong, we need to detach. ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=851))
1
- I’ve learned that two kinds of detachment are especially useful: detaching your present from your past and detaching your opinions from your identity. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=852))
1
- Who you are should be a question of what you value, not what you believe. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=869))
1
- The single most important driver of forecasters’ success was how often they updated their beliefs. The best forecasters went through more rethinking cycles. They had the confident humility to doubt their judgments and the curiosity to discover new information that led them to revise their predictions. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=910))
1
- That was a common mistake in 2016. Countless experts, pollsters, and pundits underestimated Trump—and Brexit—because they were too emotionally invested in their past predictions and identities. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=938))
1
- “Accept the fact that you’re going to be wrong,” Jean-Pierre advises. “Try to disprove yourself. When you’re wrong, it’s not something to be depressed about. Say, ‘Hey, I discovered something!’” ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=955))
1
- If we’re comfortable being wrong, we’re not afraid to poke fun at ourselves. ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=967))
1
- When you form an opinion, ask yourself what would have to happen to prove it false. Then keep track of your views so you can see when you were right, when you were wrong, and how your thinking has evolved. “I started out just wanting to prove myself,” Jean-Pierre says. “Now I want to improve myself—to see how good I can get.” ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=981))

- Although scientists believe it will damage their reputation to admit that their studies failed to replicate, the reverse is true: they’re judged more favorably if they acknowledge the new data rather than deny them. After all, it doesn’t matter “whose fault it is that something is broken if it’s your responsibility to fix it,” actor Will Smith has said. “Taking responsibility is taking your power back.” ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=993))
1
- If we choose to express them out loud, though, I think it’s our responsibility to ground them in logic and facts, share our reasoning with others, and change our minds when better evidence emerges. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=999))

- Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions. —Oscar Wilde ([Location 1027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1027))
1
- But Etty has identified another flavor called task conflict—clashes about ideas and opinions. We have task conflict when we’re debating whom to hire, which restaurant to pick for dinner, or whether to name our child Gertrude or Quasar. The question is whether the two types of conflict have different consequences. ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1045))
1
- A meta-analysis of those studies showed that relationship conflict is generally bad for performance, but some task conflict can be beneficial: it’s ([Location 1059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1059))
1
- Relationship conflict is destructive in part because it stands in the way of rethinking. When a clash gets personal and emotional, we become self-righteous preachers of our own views, spiteful prosecutors of the other side, or single-minded politicians who dismiss opinions that don’t come from our side. Task conflict can be constructive when it brings diversity of thought, preventing us from getting trapped in overconfidence cycles. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1063))
1
- It’s called agreeableness, and it’s one of the major personality traits around the world. Agreeable people tend to be nice. Friendly. Polite. Canadian. ([Location 1088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1088))
1
- Studies in oil drilling and tech companies suggest that dissatisfaction promotes creativity only when people feel committed and supported—and that cultural misfits are most likely to add value when they have strong bonds with their colleagues. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1116))
1
- We learn more from people who challenge our thought process than those who affirm our conclusions. Strong leaders engage their critics and make themselves stronger. ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1141))
1
- We won’t have much luck changing other people’s minds if we refuse to change ours. We can demonstrate openness by acknowledging where we agree with our critics and even what we’ve learned from them. Then, when we ask what views they might be willing to revise, we’re not hypocrites. ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1400))

- When I asked Harish how to improve at finding common ground, he offered a surprisingly practical tip. Most people immediately start with a straw man, poking holes in the weakest version of the other side’s case. He does the reverse: he considers the strongest version of their case, which is known as the steel man. ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1425))
1
- Instead of trying to dismantle the argument that preschool is good for kids, Harish accepted that the point was valid, which allowed him to relate to his opponent’s perspective—and to the audience’s. Then it was perfectly fair and balanced for him to express his concerns about whether a subsidy would give the most underprivileged kids access to preschool. ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1429))
1
- Like a skilled negotiator, Harish focused on just two reasons against them. He knew that making too many points could come at the cost of developing, elaborating, and reinforcing his best ones. ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1438))
1
- There are times when preaching and prosecuting can make us more persuasive. Research suggests that the effectiveness of these approaches hinges on three key factors: how much people care about the issue, how open they are to our particular argument, and how strong-willed they are in general.

- If they’re resistant to rethinking, more reasons simply give them more ammunition to shoot our views down. ([Location 1450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=1450))
1

When we gave them different kinds of reasons to donate, we triggered their awareness that someone was trying to persuade them—and they shielded themselves against it.

Within the first minute, he asserted that just because preschools are good doesn’t mean that they should be funded by the government, and then inquired, “Why is that the case?” He went on to ask whether preschools were underprovided, whether they did help the most disadvantaged—and then why they didn’t, why they were so costly, and who they actually helped instead.

- There’s some evidence that common identity can build bridges between rivals. In one experiment, psychologists randomly assigned Manchester United soccer fans a short writing task. They then staged an emergency in which a passing runner slipped and fell, screaming in pain as he held his ankle. He was wearing the T-shirt of their biggest rival, and the question was whether they would stop to help him. If the soccer fans had just written about why they loved their team, only 30 percent helped. If they had written about what they had in common with other soccer fans, 70 percent helped.

- In an experiment with my colleagues Alison Fragale and Karren Knowlton, we asked UNC students to help improve the job application of a peer. If we mentioned that he went to Duke rather than UNC, as long as he was facing significant financial need, participants spent extra time helping him. Once they felt empathy for his plight, they saw him as a unique individual deserving of assistance and liked him more. Yet when we measured their views of Duke students in general, the UNC students were just as likely to see them as their rivals, to say that it felt like a personal compliment if they heard someone criticize Duke, and to take it as a personal insult if they heard Duke praised. We had succeeded in changing their attitudes toward the student, but failed in changing their stereotypes of the group.

- In psychology, counterfactual thinking involves imagining how the circumstances of our lives could have unfolded differently. When we realize how easily we could have held different stereotypes, we might be more willing to update our views.* To activate counterfactual thinking, you might ask people questions like: How would your stereotypes be different if you’d been born Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American? What opinions would you hold if you’d been raised on a farm versus in a city, or in a culture on the other side of the world? What beliefs would you cling to if you lived in the 1700s?

- Focusing on results might be good for short-term performance, but it can be an obstacle to long-term learning. Sure enough, social scientists find that when people are held accountable only for whether the outcome was a success or failure, they are more likely to continue with ill-fated courses of action. Exclusively praising and rewarding results is dangerous because it breeds overconfidence in poor strategies, incentivizing people to keep doing things the way they’ve always done them.

Requiring proof is an enemy of progress. This is why companies like Amazon use a principle of disagree and commit. As Jeff Bezos explained it in an annual shareholder letter, instead of demanding convincing results, experiments start with asking people to make bets. “Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it?” The goal in a learning culture is to welcome these kinds of experiments, to make rethinking so familiar that it becomes routine.

- Escalation of commitment happens because we’re rationalizing creatures, constantly searching for self-justifications for our prior beliefs as a way to soothe our egos, shield our images, and validate our past decisions.

- identity foreclosure—when we settle prematurely on a sense of self without enough due diligence, and close our minds to alternative selves. ([Location 2951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=2951))

- My advice to students is to take a cue from health-care professions. Just as they make appointments with the doctor and the dentist even when nothing is wrong, they should schedule checkups on their careers. I encourage them to put a reminder in their calendars to ask some key questions twice a year. When did you form the aspirations you’re currently pursuing, and how have you changed since then? Have you reached a learning plateau in your role or your workplace, and is it time to consider a pivot? ([Location 2997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08H177WQP&location=2997))

- Deciding to leave a current career path is often easier than identifying a new one. My favorite framework for navigating that challenge comes from a management professor, Herminia Ibarra. She finds that as people consider career choices and transitions, it helps to think like scientists. A first step is to entertain possible selves: identify some people you admire within or outside your field, and observe what they actually do at work day by day. A second step is to develop hypotheses about how these paths might align with your own interests, skills, and values. A third step is to test out the different identities by running experiments: do informational interviews, job shadowing, and sample projects to get a taste of the work. The goal is not to confirm a particular plan but to expand your repertoire of possible selves—which keeps you open to rethinking.
