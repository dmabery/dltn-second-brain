## Highlights
1
- To the extent that experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of experience, having a better memory would mean knowing not only more about the world, but also more about myself. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=207))
1
- “What you have to understand is that even average memories are remarkably powerful if used properly,” ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=232))
1
- “think in more memorable ways” using the “extraordinarily simple” 2,500-year-old mnemonic technique known as the “memory palace” that Simonides of Ceos had supposedly invented in the rubble of the great banquet hall collapse. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=238))
1
- method of loci, and more broadly as the ars memorativa, or “art of memory”—were refined and codified in an extensive set of rules and instruction manuals by Romans like Cicero and Quintilian, and flowered in the Middle Ages as a way for the pious to memorize everything from sermons and prayers to the punishments awaiting the wicked in hell. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=240))
1
- Only through memorizing, the thinking went, could ideas truly be incorporated into one’s psyche and their values absorbed. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=248))

- Alexander Technique). ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=263))
1
- “What we have been doing over the last century is defining memory incorrectly, understanding it incompletely, applying it inappropriately, and condemning it because it doesn’t work and isn’t enjoyable,” Buzan argues. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=272))
1
- Our culture is an edifice built of externalized memories. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=374))

- Penfield used electrical probes to stimulate the brains of epileptic patients while they were lying conscious on the operating table with their skulls exposed. He was trying to pinpoint the source of their epilepsy, and hopefully cure it, but he found that when his probe touched certain parts of his patients’ temporal lobes, something very unexpected happened. The patients started describing vivid, long-forgotten memories. When he touched the same spot again, he often elicited the same memory. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=483))
1
- What Ericsson expected to learn from these accounts was the same thing he’s found in every other field of expertise that he’s studied: Experts see the world differently. They notice things that nonexperts don’t see. They home in on the information that matters most, and have an almost automatic sense of what to do with it. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=853))
1
- “phonological loop,” which is just a fancy name for the little voice that we can hear inside our head when we talk to ourselves. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=920))
1
- Even if his short-term memory was limited, he’d figured out a way to store information directly in long-term memory. It involved a technique called chunking. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=925))
1
- Chunking is a way to decrease the number of items you have to remember by increasing the size of each item. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=926))
1
- The twelve-digit numerical string 120741091101 is pretty hard to remember. Break it into four chunks—120, 741, 091, 101—and it becomes a little easier. Turn it into two chunks, 12/07/41 and 09/11/01, and they’re almost impossible to forget. You could even turn those dates into a single chunk of information by remembering it as “the two big surprise attacks on American soil.” ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=932))
1
- In other words, when it comes to chunking—and to our memory more broadly—what we already know determines what we’re able to learn. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=938))
1
- He discovered that he could take meaningless bits of information, run them through a filter that applied meaning to them, and make that information much stickier. He had taken his past experiences and used them to shape how he perceived the present. He was using associations in his long-term memory to see the numbers differently. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=942))
1
- The chess experiments reveal a telling fact about memory, and about expertise in general: We don’t remember isolated facts; we remember things in context. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=987))
1
- In the same way that a few pages ago we used our knowledge of historic dates to chunk the twelve-digit number, chess masters use the vast library of chess patterns that they’ve cached away in long-term memory to chunk the board. At the root of the chess master’s skill is that he or she simply has a richer vocabulary of chunks to recognize. Which is why it is so rare for anyone to achieve world-class status in chess—or any other field—without years of experience. ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=989))
1
- Using magnetoencephalography, a technique that measures the weak magnetic fields given off by a thinking brain, researchers have found that higher-rated chess players are more likely to engage the frontal and parietal cortices of the brain when they look at the board, which suggests that they are recalling information from long-term memory. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=998))
1
- According to Ericsson, what we call expertise is really just “vast amounts of knowledge, pattern-based retrieval, and planning mechanisms acquired over many years of experience in the associated domain.” In other words, a great memory isn’t just a by-product of expertise; it is the essence of expertise. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1005))
1
- In ways as obscure as sexing chickens and as profound as diagnosing an illness, who we are and what we do is fundamentally a function of what we remember. ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1013))
1
- EP has two types of amnesia—anterograde, which means he can’t form new memories, and retrograde, which means he can’t recall old memories either, at least not since about 1950. ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1064))
1
- But without the ability to compare today’s feelings to yesterday’s, he cannot tell any cohesive narrative about himself, or about those around him, which makes him incapable of providing even the most basic psychological sustenance to his family and friends. ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1089))
1
- It’s a point well illustrated by Michel Siffre, a French chronobiologist (he studies the relationship between time and living organisms) who conducted one of the most extraordinary acts of self-experimentation in the history of science. In 1962, Siffre spent two months living in total isolation in a subterranean cave, without access to clock, calendar, or sun. Sleeping and eating only when his body told him to, he sought to discover how the natural rhythms of human life would be affected by living “beyond time.” ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1127))

- Monotony collapses time; novelty unfolds it. You can exercise daily and eat healthily and live a long life, while experiencing a short one. If you spend your life sitting in a cubicle and passing papers, one day is bound to blend unmemorably into the next—and disappear. That’s why it’s important to change routines regularly, and take vacations to exotic locales, and have as many new experiences as possible that can serve to anchor our memories. Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives. ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1138))

- “In youth we may have an absolutely new experience, subjective or objective, every hour of the day. Apprehension is vivid, retentiveness strong, and our recollections of that time, like those of a time spent in rapid and interesting travel, are of something intricate, multitudinous and long-drawn-out,” he wrote. “But as each passing year converts some of this experience into automatic routine which we hardly note at all, the days and the weeks smooth themselves out in recollection to contentless units, and the years grow hollow and collapse.” Life seems to speed up as we get older because life gets less memorable as we get older. “If to remember is to be human, then remembering more means being more human,” said Ed. There ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1143))
1
- Much of what science knows about memory was learned from a damaged brain remarkably similar to EP’s. It belonged to another amnesic named Henry Molaison, who went by the initials HM ([Location 1155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1155))
1
- This phenomenon of unconscious remembering, known as priming, is evidence of an entire shadowy underworld of memories lurking beneath the surface of our conscious reckoning. ([Location 1190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1190))
1
- scientists generally divide memories broadly into two types: declarative and nondeclarative (sometimes referred to as explicit and implicit). Declarative memories are things you know you remember, like the color of your car, or what happened yesterday afternoon. EP and HM had lost the ability to make new declarative memories. Nondeclarative memories are the things you know unconsciously, like how to ride a bike or how to draw a shape while looking at it in a mirror (or what a word flashed rapidly across a computer screen means). ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1192))
1
- Motor skill learning takes place largely in the cerebellum, perceptual learning in the neocortex, habit learning in the basal ganglia. ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1197))
1
- Within the category of declarative memories, psychologists make a further distinction between semantic memories, or memories for facts and concepts, and episodic memories, or memories of the experiences of our own lives. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1200))
1
- Recalling that I had eggs for breakfast this morning would be an episodic memory. Knowing that breakfast is the first meal of the day is a semantic memory. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1201))
1
- For some unknown reason, it’s the most recent memories that blur first in most amnesics, while distant memories retain their clarity. This phenomenon is known as Ribot’s Law, after the nineteenth-century French psychologist who first noted it, and it’s a pattern found also in Alzheimer’s patients. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1208))
1
- Each time we think about a memory, we integrate it more deeply into our web of other memories, and therefore make it more stable and less likely to be dislodged. ([Location 1211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1211))
1
- One well-supported hypothesis holds that our memories are nomadic. While the hippocampus is involved in their initial formation, their contents are ultimately held in long-term storage in the neocortex. Over time, as they are revisited and reinforced, memories are consolidated in a way that makes them impervious to erasure. ([Location 1218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1218))
1
- The neocortex is not fully developed until about the third or fourth year, around the time that children start laying down permanent memories. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1242))
1
- He started his lesson with the most basic principle of all mnemonics: “elaborative encoding.” ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1298))
1
- Our memories weren’t built for the modern world, he explained. Like our vision, our capacity for language, our ability to walk upright, and every other one of our biological faculties, our memories evolved through a process of natural selection in an environment that was quite different from the one we live in today. ([Location 1299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1299))
1
- memory techniques is to do what the synasthete S did instinctually: to take the kinds of memories our brains aren’t good at holding on to and transform them into the kinds of memories our brains were built for. ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1314))
1
- Just about anything that could be imagined, he reckoned, could be imprinted upon one’s memory, and kept in good order, simply by engaging one’s spatial memory in the act of remembering. ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1354))
1
- To use Simonides’ technique, all one has to do is convert something unmemorable, like a string of numbers or a deck of cards or a shopping list or Paradise Lost, into a series of engrossing visual images and mentally arrange them within an imagined space, and suddenly those forgettable items become unforgettable. ([Location 1355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1355))
1
- In other words, natural memory is the hardware you’re born with. Artificial memory is the software you run on your hardware. ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1388))
1
- Artificial memory, the anonymous author continues, has two basic components: images and places. Images represent the contents of what one wishes to remember. Places—or loci, as they’re called in the original Latin—are where those images are stored. ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1389))
1
- “Now, it’s very important to try to remember this image multisensorily.” The more associative hooks a new piece of information has, the more securely it gets embedded into the network of things you already know, and the more likely it is to remain in memory. ([Location 1424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1424))
1
- The more vivid the image, the more likely it is to cleave to its locus. What distinguishes a great mnemonist, I was learning, is the ability to create these sorts of lavish images on the fly, to paint in the mind a scene so unlike any that has been seen before that it cannot be forgotten. ([Location 1444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1444))
1
- Rather, it’s difficult to remember last week’s lunch because your brain has filed it away with all the other lunches you’ve ever eaten as just another lunch. When we try to recall something from a category that includes as many instances as “lunch” or “wine,” many memories compete for our attention. The memory of last Wednesday’s lunch isn’t necessarily gone; it’s that you lack the right hook to pull it out of a sea of lunchtime memories. ([Location 1478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H4XI5O&location=1478))
