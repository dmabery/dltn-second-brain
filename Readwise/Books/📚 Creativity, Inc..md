## Highlights
1
- What makes Pixar special is that we acknowledge we will always have problems, many of them hidden from our view; that we work hard to uncover these problems, even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable; and that, when we come across a problem, we marshal all of our energies to solve it. ([Location 56](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=56))
1
- My belief is that good leadership can help creative people stay on the path to excellence no matter what business they’re in. ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=133))
1
- people are talented and want to contribute. We accept that, without meaning to, our company is stifling that talent in myriad unseen ways. Finally, we try to identify those impediments and fix them. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=135))
1
- believe that managers must loosen the controls, not tighten them. They must accept risk; they must trust the people they work with and strive to clear the path for them; and always, they must pay attention to and engage with anything that creates fear. Moreover, successful leaders embrace the reality that their models may be wrong or incomplete. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=145))
1
- Without intending to, we’d created an obstacle that discouraged people from jumping in. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=177))
1
- Unhindered communication was key, no matter what your position. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=185))
1
- There is the problem you know you are trying to solve—think of that as an oak tree—and then there are all the other problems—think of these as saplings—that sprouted from the acorns that fell around it. And these problems remain after you cut the oak tree down. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=201))
1
- Disney was all about inventing the new. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=219))
1
- Einstein, by contrast, was a master of explaining that which already was. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=220))
1
- I saw a way to simultaneously create art and develop a technical understanding of how to create a new kind of imagery. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=316))
1
- The lesson of ARPA had lodged in my brain: When faced with a challenge, get smarter. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=451))
1
- My willingness to do this reflected my world-view, forged in academia, that any hard problem should have many good minds simultaneously trying to solve ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=504))
1
- But as challenging as that problem proved to be, it paled in comparison to the bigger, and eternal, impediment to our progress: the human resistance to change. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=563))
1
- Clearly, it wasn’t enough for managers to have good ideas—they had to be able to engender support for those ideas among the people who’d be charged with employing them. ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=574))
1
- For all the care you put into artistry, visual polish frequently doesn’t matter if you are getting the story right. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=666))
1
- But simple answers like the “start high” pricing advice—so seductive in its rationality—had distracted me and kept me from asking more fundamental questions. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=820))
1
- Instead of merely repeating an action, workers could suggest changes, call out problems, and—this next element seemed particularly important to me—feel the pride that came when they helped fix what was broken. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=852))
1
- You don’t have to ask permission to take responsibility. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=862))
1
- When downsides coexist with upsides, as they often do, people are reluctant to explore what’s bugging them, for fear of being labeled complainers. ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1045))
1
- We took pride in the fact that reviewers talked mainly about the way Toy Story made them feel and not about the computer wizardry that enabled us to get it up on the screen. We believed that this was the direct result of our always keeping story as our guiding light. ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1093))
1
- If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1215))
1
- Getting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the ideas right. ([Location 1217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1217))
1
- To me, the answer should be obvious: Ideas come from people. Therefore, people are more important than ideas. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1230))
1
- Find, develop, and support good people, and they in turn will find, develop, and own good ideas. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1243))
1
- It was management’s job to take the long view, to intervene and protect our people from their willingness to pursue excellence at all costs. Not to do so would be irresponsible. ([Location 1256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1256))
1
- Merely repeating ideas means nothing. You must act—and think—accordingly. ([Location 1289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1289))
1
- “Trust the Process” had morphed into “Assume that the Process Will Fix Things for Us.” ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1293))
1
- At Pixar, Toy Story 2 taught us this lesson—that we must always be alert to shifting dynamics, because our future depends on it ([Location 1330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1330))
1
- You cannot address the obstacles to candor until people feel free to say that they exist ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1365))
1
- without trust, creative collaboration is not possible. ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1383))
1
- The passion expressed in a Braintrust meeting was never taken personally because everyone knew it was directed at solving problems. And largely because of that trust and mutual respect, its problem-solving powers were immense. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1401))
1
- People who take on complicated creative projects become lost at some point in the process. ([Location 1442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1442))
1
- The key was to focus less on the end goal and more on what still intrigued them about the characters who, by this point, felt like people we actually knew. ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1683))
1
- Mistakes aren’t a necessary evil. They aren’t evil at all. They are an inevitable consequence of doing something new (and, as such, should be seen as valuable; without them, we’d have no originality). ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1713))
1
- To disentangle the good and the bad parts of failure, we have to recognize both the reality of the pain and the benefit of the resulting growth. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1716))
1
- “Get a bike that’s as low to the ground as you can find, put on elbow and knee pads so you’re not afraid of falling, and go,” he says. If you apply this mindset to everything new you attempt, you can begin to subvert the negative connotation associated with making mistakes. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1721))
1
- The better, more subtle interpretation is that failure is a manifestation of learning and exploration. If you aren’t experiencing failure, then you are making a far worse mistake: You are being driven by the desire to avoid it. ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1729))
1
- As Andrew puts it, “Moving things forward allows the team you are leading to feel like, ‘Oh, I’m on a boat that is actually going towards land.’ As opposed to having a leader who says, ‘I’m still not sure. I’m going to look at the map a little bit more, and we’re just going to float here, and all of you stop rowing until I figure this out.’ ([Location 1731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1731))
1
- you’ve become what they see you as because of your inability to move.” ([Location 1735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1735))
1
- There’s a quick way to determine if your company has embraced the negative definition of failure. Ask yourself what happens when an error is discovered. Do people shut down and turn inward, instead of coming together to untangle the causes of problems that might be avoided going forward? Is the question being asked: Whose fault was this? If so, your culture is one that vilifies failure. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1747))
1
- In a fear-based, failure-averse culture, people will consciously or unconsciously avoid risk. They will seek instead to repeat something safe that’s been good enough in the past. Their work will be derivative, not innovative. But if you can foster a positive understanding of failure, the opposite will happen. ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1750))
1
- Being open about problems is the first step toward learning from them. ([Location 1755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1755))
1
- The time they’ve saved by not gnashing their teeth about whether they’re on the right course comes in handy when they hit a dead end and need to reboot. ([Location 1760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1760))
1
- It isn’t enough to pick a path—you must go down it. By doing so, you see things you couldn’t possibly see when you started out; you may not like what you see, some of it may be confusing, but at least you will have, as we like to say, “explored the neighborhood.” ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1761))
1
- “However, there’s always a guiding principle that leads you as you go down the various roads. In Monsters, Inc., all of our very different plots shared a common feeling—the bittersweet goodbye you feel once a problem”—in this case, Sulley’s quest to return Boo to her own world—“has been solved. You suffer through it as you struggle to solve it, but by the end you’ve developed a sort of fondness for it, and you miss it when it is gone. I knew I wanted to express that, and I was eventually able to get it in the film.” ([Location 1785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1785))
1
- This is key: When experimentation is seen as necessary and productive, not as a frustrating waste of time, people will enjoy their work—even when it is confounding them. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1791))
1
- So if your primary goal is to have a fully worked out, set-in-stone plan, you are only upping your chances of being unoriginal. ([Location 1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1805))
1
- In general, I have found that people who pour their energy into thinking about an approach and insisting that it is too early to act are wrong just as often as people who dive in and work quickly. ([Location 1807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1807))
1
- Being too risk-averse causes many companies to stop innovating and to reject new ideas, which is the first step on the path to irrelevance. ([Location 1866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1866))
1
- To be a truly creative company, you must start things that might fail. ([Location 1868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1868))
1
- There are two parts to any failure: There is the event itself, with all its attendant disappointment, confusion, and shame, and then there is our reaction to it. It is this second part that we control. Do we become introspective, or do we bury our heads in the sand? Do we make it safe for others to acknowledge and learn from problems, or do we shut down discussion by looking for people to blame? We must remember that failure gives us chances to grow, and we ignore those chances at our own peril. ([Location 1895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=1895))
1
- Management’s job is not to prevent risk but to build the ability to recover. ([Location 2024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2024))
1
- It lessens quality across the board. ([Location 2049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2049))
1
- From 1994 to 2010, not a single Disney animated film would open at number one at the box office. I believe this was the direct result of its employees thinking that their job was to feed the Beast. ([Location 2052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2052))
1
- Protection is used, in these contexts, to further a (small-c) conservative agenda: Don’t disrupt what already is. As a business becomes successful, meanwhile, that conservatism gains strength, and inordinate energy is directed toward protecting what has worked so far. ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2068))

    - Note: Cross Ref with netflixs strategy deck
1
- Part of our job is to protect the new from people who don’t understand that in order for greatness to emerge, there must be phases of not-so-greatness. ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2073))
1
- Making the process better, easier, and cheaper is an important aspiration, something we continually work on—but it is not the goal. Making something great is the goal. ([Location 2112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2112))
1
- I see this over and over again in other companies: A subversion takes place in which streamlining the process or increasing production supplants the ultimate goal, with each person or group thinking they’re doing the right thing—when, in fact, they have strayed off course. ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2113))
1
- Emphasis is placed on doing safer projects that mimic proven money-makers just to keep something—anything!—moving through the pipeline (see The Lion King 1½, a direct-to-video effort that came out in 2004, six years after The Lion King 2: Simba’s Pride). ([Location 2117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2117))
1
- It simply isn’t their problem; keeping the process going and the money flowing is. Each group has its own goals and expectations and acts according to its own appetites. ([Location 2132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2132))
1
- Each group, then, is trying to do the right thing, but they’re pulling in different directions. ([Location 2162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2162))
1
- If any one of those groups “wins,” we lose. In an unhealthy culture, each group believes that if their objectives trump the goals of the other groups, the company will be better off. ([Location 2163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2163))
1
- I often say that managers of creative enterprises must hold lightly to goals and firmly to intentions. What does that mean? It means that we must be open to having our goals change as we learn new information or are surprised by things we thought we knew but didn’t. As long as our intentions—our values—remain constant, our goals can shift as needed. ([Location 2198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2198))
1
- Both groups thought they were protecting the proceedings, but only one group understood that by looking for something new and surprising, they were offering the most valuable kind of protection. Negative feedback may be fun, but it is far less brave than endorsing something unproven and providing room for it to grow. ([Location 2211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2211))
1
- It means supporting our people, because we know that the best ideas emerge when we’ve made it safe to work through problems. ([Location 2219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2219))
1
- I was struck by how he didn’t understand that taking a risk necessitated a willingness to deal with the mess created by the risk. ([Location 2228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FUZQYBO&location=2228))
