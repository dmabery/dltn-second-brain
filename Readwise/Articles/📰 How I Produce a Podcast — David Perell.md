## Highlights
1
- Start your email with 1-2 sentences of specifics about what you like about their work and explicitly state that you want them to come on your podcast.
1
- The art of asking questions is about unlocking knowledge inside the interviewer that they’ve never shared publicly and often, never even knew they knew.
1
- Whenever I think of a question, I “dig vertically” by thinking of two ways to make it more specific, and “horizontally” by adding a unique perspective.
  Original question: what’s your favorite novel?
  Fracking vertically #1: what’s your favorite economics book?
  Fracking vertically #2: what’s your favorite microeconomics book?
  Fracking horizontally: what does your favorite novel teach us about microeconomics?

- "The clues to what each person loves most are usually buried in another answer... People usually have a sort of default script that they follow, and the best stuff is when you go off-script and look for things that are surprising, counterintuitive, unusual.”
1
- As an interviewer, your job is to get guests to say as many insightful things as possible — that they‘ve also never shared in public.
1
- When it comes to explicit interviewing styles, I think of podcasts on a 2x2 axis. One axis is focused on learning vs. entertainment, and the other is about hanging out versus interviewing. There are successful podcasts in every corner, but I want the podcast to be 90% learning-focused and 70% interview-focused.
1
- Tangents are the spice of conversation, so entertain them without letting them drag. Take back the lead once they lose momentum.
1
- The more specific your question, the more your guest can give an answer that reveals their exceptionalism but would otherwise sound pretentious.
