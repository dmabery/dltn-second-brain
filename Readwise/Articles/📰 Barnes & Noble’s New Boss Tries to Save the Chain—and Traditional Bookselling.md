## Highlights
1

- In Mr. Daunt’s view, the very survival of bookstores is on the line. “I don’t think we have any God-given right to exist,” he recently told a group of publishing-industry professionals. “How is it that bookstores do justify themselves in the age of Amazon? They do so by being places in which you discover books with an enjoyment, with a pleasure, with a serendipity that is simply impossible to replicate online.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1367631228/14857533))

- “As you let the stores diverge, a quarter will be brilliant and a quarter will be absolutely terrible,” Mr. Daunt said. “A significant number of your stores will become worse, not better. Then you teach and encourage them and, in time, everybody becomes better.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1367631228/14857543))

- A good bookseller has little to no returns,” Mr. Daunt said. “When you let the stores choose what they stock and choose how they price it, the returns more or less completely disappear.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1367631228/14857565))

- Mr. Daunt is working to improve Barnes & Noble’s online store, but his focus is mainly on physical stores. “It’s in the stores where you win the loyalty from your customers,” he said. “If you get your stores right, your online sales will follow. If your stores are crap, your online will be as well.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1367631228/14857568))

- Barnes & Noble currently employs about 16,500 people, down from 24,000 in April 2019. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1367631228/14857576))
