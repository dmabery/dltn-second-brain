## Highlights
1
- I reread Anathem by Neal Stephenson, a book I’d suspected might be my favorite novel. Now I can say that it is. It’s set in a culture of monastic mathematician-scientist-philosophers who retreat from society for one, ten, one hundred, or one thousand years at a time. They disconnect from the banalities and frivolties of the world to focus on long-term contemplation and study. The premise is so nerdy and esoteric that I kind of can’t believe that a book so perfectly aimed at my brain exists, is popular, and is so good.
1
- I am doing my job, participating in my family, and keeping up friendships normally. But the precious time that remains, which it’s so easy to fret about using properly and so easy to waste, is now neatly allocated by the Discipline.
1
- Each day has a focus assigned, from among five possible focuses:
1
- ⌘ Connect — Catch up on what’s going on in the world and generally be a normal modern human.
1
- ❥ Read — I read at least a bit every day anyway, but on a Read day, I’ll try to spend all of my available time reading. This should be solid, healthy stuff with something to teach.
1
- ❖ Study — Deliberately trying to understand or get better at a specific subject. Lately it’s been programming Haskell; later it may be systematic study toward level N1 of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.
1
- ✿ Play — Allowing my mind to get carried away by something imaginative. A video game, comic, concert video, or whatever other input that seems worthwhile if not entirely intellectual.
1
- ✽ Create — I’m writing this guide on a Create day! This could also mean building software, playing music, drawing pixel art, working on websites… any variation on making something.
1
- Time is divided into ten-day decades. (We commonly use the word “decade” to mean ten years, nowadays, but prior to the 16th century, it could mean any collection of ten things, including days.)
1
- At the start of each decade, I choose a template for how I’ll spend the next ten days worth of available time.
  The standard decade is ⌘ ❥ ❖ ✿ ✽ ❥ ✽ ✿ ❖ ❥.
1
- For instance the Study Focus decade is ⌘ ❖ ❥ ❖ ❖ ✿ ❖ ❖ ✽ ❖. Create & Play Focus is ⌘ ✽ ✿ ❥ ✽ ✿ ✽ ❖ ✿ ✽. And so on.
1
- something that’s not of value after ten days is not of value
1
- Now — remember that this Discipline is about available time left over after fulfilling the responsibilities of the day. So I still talk to friends, family, and colleagues every day.
1
- Connection that can happen on any day:
  One-on-one conversations with friends
  Reading posts and emails
  Hanging out, or making plans to hang out
  Doing my dang job
  Connection that happens only on the Connect day:
  Reading the news
  Watching videos (YouTube recommendations fill up with genuinely good stuff if you only check them every ten days!)
  Hanging out in close-knit online communities of friends
  Connection that shouldn’t happen:
  Spending time on public online spaces like Twitter, where intense stimulus goes past faster than you can properly process it
  Clicking around sites like YouTube or Reddit, seeking out something to spend time and attention on
1
- That brings me to the paramount rule of this system: when in doubt, go to bed.
1
- My in-the-moment self doesn’t fret about how to spend time anymore; a wiser, longer-term version of me has already decided it. I don’t worry about whether I’m letting an important pursuit languish too long, because each of them happens at least once every ten days.
