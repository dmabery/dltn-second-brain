## Highlights
1
- That’s because creative expression is often used as a gateway to something more practical, and is rarely accepted as something practical in itself. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494643))

- With that said, is there a good way to categorize what’s an act of creative expression, and what is not? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494649))
1
- An act of expression can only be deemed creative when it is aligned with one’s true curiosities and interests. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494651))

- In other words, the internet enabled a vision where creativity and practicality were directly correlated. The more effort you put into your creative output, the greater the practical benefits would be ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494657))
1
- Patience is only possible when you have the requisite headspace to cultivate it, and having your financial needs covered is absolutely critical for this. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494660))
1
- This is the Arc of the Practical Creator. It balances the passion of creativity with the practicality of money, and encourages you to consider both to make your endeavor sustainable. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494662))
1
- But this is where the power of reframing comes in. A Practical Creator doesn’t view a boring job as a dead-end endeavor, but as an active patron of their creativity ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494670))
1
- The key to viewing your employer as a patron of your art, however, is contingent upon one important thing: When you’re in this first stage, you must rigorously work on your creative endeavors after your day job responsibilities. This is an absolute must ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494673))
1
- You are exchanging a majority of your workday for money, which buys you the freedom required to spend the minority of your day on your creative endeavor. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494675))
1
- Throughout our upbringing and our time in the educational system, we are taught that an expenditure of effort leads to an immediate reward. If you clean your room, you’ll get to have pizza for dinner. If you study hard for an exam, you’ll get a good grade. If you have a great interview, you’ll get that great job. And so on. The causal chain linking effort and reward is perpetually reinforced in our most formative years, which carries with us well into adulthood.
  The issue is that this chain breaks down when we want to walk our own paths. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494683))
1
- This goes against everything we’ve been conditioned to experience, so we often give up on our creative pursuits well before they’ve had the required time to catch people’s attention. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494685))
1
- In this case, patience is your greatest asset. If you stay determined and stay honest about progress, then the only remaining variable is time. Time is the force that allows serendipity to materialize, and this is something you can’t will into existence. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494696))
1
- The only thing you can control is the quality of what you produce and the cadence in which you publish. The rest must be left up to how others internalize and share your work, which is something neither you nor I should seek to control. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494697))
1
- And most importantly, you’re working on your craft with a rigor and commitment that accentuates the best of your abilities. All of these things are strong indicators that you’re not just in hobby territory anymore; this is now a career that you’re actively working on. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494701))

- But no one thinks that you have to be the CEO of a company to justify your career there. No, a career begins at the entry-level, from the moment you get compensated and recognized for your capacity to solve problems. If those conditions are satisfied (at whatever scale) and you are serious about improving yourself as a creator, then you have a career.

1
- Without anything to strive for, we are just as lost as the person striving for the wrong thing. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494709))
1
- In this final stage of the arc, grow your curiosities, but preserve your attention. Cultivate a beginner’s mind for the things you want to learn about, and the things that expand your intellectual horizons. Let your inner child roam free. Learn things for their own sake, and not for their utility. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494711))
1
- In this stage, patience takes the form of tolerance. You’d rather not spend 8 hours at a job you don’t care for, but you realize what it enables you to do. It gives you the financial breathing room required to work on your craft on the evenings and weekends, and allows you to endure the delay in outcomes.

- Gratitude for the undesirable is what defines patience here. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1504343697/19494729))
